An online energy transition atlas launched by Brian Holmes (researcher, cartographer) and Majk Shkurti (GIS developer). Built on the basis of an earlier prototype by BH and edward sharp (https://github.com/Brian393/ecotopia-today).

OpenLayers, Geoserver and a PostGIS database lie at the heart of an advanced geographic information system, programmed for spatial analysis and authentified collaboration. It's all put together with Docker (see docker-compose.yaml)

The project isn't finished yet, and nor is this ReadMe. More coming soon.
