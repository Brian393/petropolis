"EPA": "The Deepwater Horizon was a state-of-the-art drilling rig, owned by Transocean, contracted by BP and serviced by Halliburton. Its work on the Macondo well, a mile beneath the surface of the water, was supposed to release another geyser of shareholder value for cost-cutting CEO Tony Hayward. One day before the blowout, BP and Transocean officials visited the rig, ostensibly to congratulate the crew on a 7-year safety record, but presumably to pressure them to quickly finish the job. Subsequently it emerged that BP managers <a href='http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/08/bp_manager_boss_both_ignored_w.html'>deliberately ignored warnings</a> about the inadequacies of the company's plans for the cement plug that would conclude drilling operations. After the explosion and surging fire beginning on April 20, 2010, the rig finally collapsed and sank beneath the waves on April 22. Five thousand feet below, the Macondo wellhead continued spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico until June 15 - approximately five million barrels all told, some twenty times the quantity leaked by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska. The public relations battle carried on through the excessive use of the dispersant Corexit, <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/riki-ott/an-open-letter-to-us-epa_b_697376.html'>denounced by marine toxicologist Riki Ott</a>, was among the most cynical aspects of the disaster's treatment by the corporate state. The BP spill is accounted the worst environmental disaster in the United States since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The consequences are ongoing. Tony Hayward, who left BP in the wake of the spill, is now <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/tony-hayward-comback-bp-oil-spill-glencore-xstrata-chairman-gulf-of-mexico-disaster'>CEO of Glencore Xstrata</a>, one of the largest mineral extraction corporations on earth.<br>",
