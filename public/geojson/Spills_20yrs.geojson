THERE  WERE NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR FIRES. DAMAGES MAY EXCEED $50,000 DUE TO THE COST OF REPAIRS. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO EXTERNAL SOIL OR WATERWAYS. ALL  INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS ON MARCH 17, 2017 AT 11:33 AND  ASSIGNED INCIDENT ID: 1548.    THE TANK HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY REMOVED FROM SERVICE AND AN API 653 INSPECTION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. INITIAL FINDINGS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE TOP-SIDE OF  THE TANK BOTTOM HAS EXPERIENCED CORROSION AND PRODUCT HAS REACHED THE INTERSTITIAL SPACE BETWEEN THE UNDERLYING HDPE LINER AND THE TANK BOTTOM. IT IS  ESTIMATED THAT 263 BARRELS OF CRUDE PRODUCT COULD BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE INTERSTITIAL SPACE.      UPDATE: JULY 31, 2017  DAMAGES HAVE EXCEEDED $1.8 MILLION DUE TO THE COST OF REPAIRS AND REMEDIATION.  LONG TERM REMEDIATION HAS BEEN INITIATED FOR THE UNDERLYING GROUND WATER. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE TOP-SIDE OF THE TANK BOTTOM EXPERIENCED CORROSION AND PRODUCT BREACHED THE UNDERLYING HDPE LINER.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 390 BARRELS OF CRUDE PRODUCT WAS RELEASED AS A RESULT OF THIS FAILURE.  APPROXIMATELY 100 BARRELS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED.  AN ESTIMATED 290 BARRELS ARE CONFINED WITHIN THE SOIL AND GROUND WATER.  REMEDIATION WELLS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND A MULTI-PHASE EXTRACTION SYSTEM IS BEING INSTALLED TO REMOVE ADDITIONAL HYDROCARBONS.  THE TANK IS EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN SERVICE ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2017.  A MORE DEFINITIVE EXPLANATION ON THE TYPE OF CORROSION EXPERIENCED BY THE TANK BOTTOM WILL BE PROVIDED UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY.",

LOCAL OPERATORS REQUESTED THAT THE LEVEL IN THE TANK NOT CHANGE UNLESS THEY WERE NOTIFIED TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE ROLLING LADDER. THE LEVEL IN THE TANK STAYED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME UNTIL FEBRUARY. DURING THIS TIME (NOV. - FEB.) THE CRUDE OIL TEMPERATURE IN TANK C4 WENT FROM 58 DEG F TO 25 DEG F. AS THE CRUDE OIL BECAME COLDER LESS AND LESS MELTING OF THE SNOW AND ICE LOAD OCCURRED AND WITH EACH STORM MORE SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATED ON THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE ROOF. WARMER WEATHER DURING THE FIRST WEEK IN FEBRUARY STARTED TO MELT THE SNOW\/ICE BUILD UP ON THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE ROOF. ON FEBRUARY 8TH THE LOCAL AREA OPERATOR WENT DOWN ON THE ROOF, REMOVED THE PLUG FROM THE ROOF DRAIN, AND OPENED THE ROOF DRAIN VALVE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TANK. THIS VALVE WAS LEFT OPEN TO LET THE THAWING WATER TO EXIT THE TANK ROOF. AS MORE ICE AND SNOW MELTED MORE OF THE LOAD WAS CONCENTRATED TO A PORTION OF THE TANK AWAY FROM THE ROOF DRAIN AND IN THE AREA OF THE VACUUM\/PRESSURE VENT. EVENTUALLY THE LOCALIZED SNOW\/ICE\/WATER LOAD IN THIS AREA CAUSED THE TOP OF THE VACUUM\/PRESSURE VENT (18\") TO BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE OIL IN THE TANK. NOW OIL WAS FLOWING ONTO THE ROOF AND EVENTUALLY THE OIL MADE ITS WAY TO THE ROOF DRAIN AND OUT OF THE OPEN ROOF DRAIN VALVE. MOST THE RELEASED OIL WAS CONTAINED IN THE TANK'S SECONDARY CONTAINMENT, HOWEVER, SOME WIND BORNE CRUDE OIL WAS CARRIED OFF SITE DUE TO HIGH WINDS AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE.",

VALVE REPLACEMENT WAS THE ONLY SCOPE OF WORK THE CREW WAS PERFORMING AT THE TIME.  PER THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION, THE CREW FOLLOWED THE EXISTING PROCEDURES FOR BOLTED FLANGES, HOWEVER, THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW VALVE ELIMINATED THE VALVE'S CONTACT WITH THE EXISTING SUPPORT.  JAYHAWK HAS COMPLETED THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT TO BE INADEQUATE PIPE SUPPORT SPACING WITH A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR OF INADEQUATE FLANGE TORQUE.  JAYHAWK IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING MAINLINE PIPE SUPPORT SPACING AND REVIEWING THE NEED TO INCORPORATE TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS INTO EXISTING PROCEDURES.      THE TOTAL PRODUCT LOST FROM THE PIPELINE WAS 72 BARRELS.  41 BARRELS OF FREE PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED AND THE 31 BARREL BALANCE WAS CLEANED UP WITH APPROXIMATELY 286 CUBIC YARDS OF CONTAMINATED MATERIAL BEING PLACED ON AN EXISTING REMEDIATION PLOT.",

THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY COMMANDED THE VALVE OPEN AT 9:21 PM  AND THE VALVE WAS FULLY OPENED BY 9:22 PM.     SHORTLY AFTER REPORTING TO DUTY, THE DAY CONTROLLER NOTICED AN IMBALANCE ON THE OVER\/SHORT FOR WCII PIPELINE.  THE CONTROLLER CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER MANAGER AT 6:45 AM AND IT WAS DECIDED TO SHUT WCII PIPELINE DOWN.  BY 7:00 AM SHUTDOWN WAS COMPLETE. THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED AT 7:38 AM BY ROGER PFEIFER, A COMPANY EMPLOYEE WHO WAS CONDUCTING HIS DAILY STATION CHECK. ROGER CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER AT 7:38 AM TO LOCKOUT PUMP #2 (P-3352).  ALL INTERNAL,STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED AND ACME ENVIRONMENTAL, OSRO, WAS CONTACTED TO MUSTER PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO THE SITE. IT WAS DETERMINED BY PIPELINE OVER & SHORT ANALYSIS THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,722 BBLS OF DJ BASIN DERIVED CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM AN OUTBOARD SEAL FAILURE ON PUMP 2 (P-3352) AT SHARON SPRINGS STATION.  LESS THAN 20 BBLS OF FREE OIL WERE RECOVERED AT THE SITE.      CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED TO SOIL IN NE PORTION OF THE STATION, ALONG HIGHWAY 27 KDOT ROW EAST OF THE STATION FENCE AND APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET NORTH OF THE STATION FENCE IN TWO STREAMS.  ONE STREAM WAS APPROXIMATELY 510 FEET IN LENGTH ON THE MILLS PROPERTY AND THE OTHER STREAM WAS APPROXIMATELY 350 FEET LONG ON THE HIGHWAY 27 KDOT ROW.  THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP, AS APPROVED BY THE KDHE, CONSISTED OF A LARGE SCALE DIG AND HAUL OPERATION THAT REMOVED APPROXIMATELY 14,000 CUBIC YARDS OF IMPACTED SOIL.  THE MILLS PROPERTY AND KDOT ROW WAS CLEANED UP TO RESIDENTIAL STANDARDS.  COMPANY PROPERTY IS BEING CLEANED UP TO NON-RESIDENTIAL STANDARDS.  EXCAVATED SOIL HAS BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE HANSON RANCH FOR LAND FARMING UNDER THE APPROVAL AND AUTHORIZATION OF THE KDHE.    PROPOSED ACTION PLAN:  1.  MODIFY THE PUMP CONTROL PROGRAM (SYSTEM WIDE) AS FOLLOWS:  A) ADD THE MISSING SEQUENCE START COMMAND CONTACT.  B) ADD AN UNINTENDED SUCTION VALVE CLOSURE SHUTDOWN.                 2. REMOVE THE \"SEQUENCE START\" COMMAND FROM SCADA UNTIL PROGRAMING CHANGES ARE MADE SYSTEM WIDE.        3,  ADD A REDUNDANT SEAL LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM THAT WILL DETECT PRESSURE (SYSTEM WIDE).        4.  INSTALL FULLY ENCLOSED SEAL COVERS (SYSTEM WIDE).                  5.  ADD A VALVE CLOSURE DISCRETE BIT AND UPDATED THE CONTROL CENTER ALARM DICTIONARY (SYSTEM WIDE).  THIS INCLUDES TRAINING OF THE  CONTROL CENTER OPERATORS.      6  CLEAN UP CONTINUES AT THE STATION WITH APPROXIMATELY 98% RECOVERY.    THE FINAL TOTAL CONTAMINATED SOIL REMOVED WAS 14,474 YARDS.",

UNTIL THE DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2016 NUMEROUS METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE(S) OF THE IMBALANCE.  AT NO TIME DURING THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS DID THE IMBALANCE EXCEED ESTABLISHED NORMAL OPERATING TOLERANCES.  THE OVER\/SHORT CALCULATIONS WERE REVIEWED ALONGSIDE CPM DATA TO ASSESS ALIGNMENT BETWEEN WHAT THE TWO METHODS WERE REPORTING.  CPM WAS NOT YET FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND WAS BEING RUN IN PARALLEL WITH NORMAL HOURLY OVER\/SHORT LINE BALANCE CALCULATIONS.  DURING THE TIMEFRAME BETWEEN AUGUST 29 AND SEPTEMBER 10 THE LINE WAS PATROLLED NUMEROUS TIMES VIA AERIAL, WALKING, DRIVING AND COMBINATIONS OF THESE METHODS.  ADDITIONALLY, METERS WERE CHECKED FOR ACCURACY AND FUNCTION WITH ISSUES IDENTIFIED ON SEPTEMBER 3 AND 6 THAT REQUIRED REPAIRS.  TANK TO TANK LINE BALANCE CALCULATIONS WERE ALSO EMPLOYED.  ON SEPTEMBER 2 A STATIC PRESSURE TEST WAS CARRIED OUT BUT THE RESULTS DID NOT IDENTIFY A LEAK CONDITION.  ON THE EVENING OF SEPTEMBER 9 A SECOND STATIC PRESSURE TEST WAS INITIATED.  THIS TEST WAS TERMINATED AT 13:16 ON SEPTEMBER 10 WHEN INDICATIONS POINTED TO A SUSPECTED RELEASE.  PATROL OF THE PIPELINE CONTINUED THAT DAY UNTIL THE DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE VIA GROUND PATROL AT APPROXIMATELY 17:15.      SUBSEQUENT TO DISCOVERY THE LINE WAS EXCAVATED AND A THROUGH WALL FAILURE WAS OBSERVED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE FAILED PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED. LINE WAS RESTARTED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2016 UNDER A PHMSA REQUIRED 20% REDUCTION IN OPERATING PRESSURE. METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED PIPE CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE THROUGH WALL LEAK WAS EXTERNAL PITTING\/CORROSION LOCATED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION, ADJACENT TO A GIRTH WELD, AT A SINGLE PIT.  THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE CORROSION RATE WAS DC STRAY CURRENT INTERFERENCE FROM AN ADJACENT PIPELINE.  ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL HAS BEEN REMOVED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL OR REMEDIATED ON SITE.  PHMSA ISSUED A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER (CAO) IN RESPONSE TO THIS ACCIDENT (CPF 4-2016-5030H).  A ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS (RCFA) WAS CONDUCTED AND IDENTIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT TO PRE CONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENTS AND CONTROL ROOM PROCEDURES.

THE LINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND ISOLATED BY CLOSING ROV'S AT ENID AND PONCA CITY.  SHORTLY AFTER RECEIVING THE SCADA ALARM, A TELEPHONE CALL WAS RECEIVED FROM A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR STATING THAT THEY HAD STRUCK OUR LINE WITH TRENCHING EQUIPMENT CAUSING A RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL THAT WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXCAVATED TRENCH.  MAGELLAN FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THE RELEASED PRODUCT (CRUDE OIL) WAS CONTAINED IN THE TRENCH, THUS MINIMIZING IMPACT.  THE SITE WAS SAFELY SECURED AND PRODUCT RECOVERY WAS INITIATED UTILIZING VACUUM TRUCKS AND PORTABLE FRAC TANKS.  THE LINE WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE DAMAGED LINE PIPE WITH NEW, PRE-TESTED PIPE.

NO IMPACT TO WATER.  AT 00:27 ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2015 THE PIPELINE CONTROLLER RECEIVED A HIGH-HIGH ALARM IN CONTROL ROOM FOR TANK #4202 AT DICKINSON STATION. THE OPERATOR ACKNOWLEDGED THE ALARM, DOCUMENTED THE TANK LEVEL AND INITIATED A SHUTDOWN OF THE DICKENSON PUMP STATION.   CONTROLLER INTENDED TO SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE PIPELINE BUT INADVERTENTLY INITIATED A SHUTDOWN OF ONLY THE DICKENSON OUTBOUND PUMP AND NOT THE UPSTREAM PUMP STATION AT BURKETT. THIS ACTION RESULTED IN THE FLOW OF OIL TO REMAIN FLOWING INTO DICKENSON.  THE CONTROLLER INTENDED TO SHUTDOWN PIPELINE OPERATIONS FOR THE DAY BUT MISTAKENLY LEFT THE BURKETT STATION RUNNING. THE HIGH LEVEL ALARMS CONTINUED TO SOUND IN THE CONTROL ROOM AND WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE CONTROLLER. THE CONTROLLER FELL ASLEEP AND WAS AWAKENED AT 04:20 BY THE ALARMS.

AT 10:58 LOCAL TIME COUNTRYMARK SHUT DOWN THE ALBION TO BOOSTER PIPELINE SECTION AND STARTED MONITORING PRESSURES.  BY THAT TIME COUNTRYMARK HAD PUT INTO ACTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO INVESTIGATE, ISOLATE AND TRY TO CONTAIN THE SPILL, NOT BEING SURE IF IT WAS FROM COUNTRYMARK'S ALBION PIPELINE OR POSSIBLY FROM MARATHON'S PIPELINE.    COUNTRYMARK SENT SURVEY AIRCRAFT TO INVESTIGATE AND GATHERED INFORMATION FROM THE SCADA SYSTEM TO HELP WITH THE DETERMINATION.  COUNTRYMARK MADE A TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION TO THE THE NRC OF A LEAK AT THAT LOCATION AT 12:40 LOCAL TIME, STILL NOT KNOWING IF IT WAS A COUNTRYMARK LEAK.  THE LINE WAS ISOLATED BY 15:30 LOCAL TIME AT THE NEAREST VALVES ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVER.  AT 16:55 LOCAL TIME COUNTRYMARK PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE SPILL WAS INDEED THE ALBION LINE LEAKING SO COUNTRYMARK CONTINUED THE EMERGENCY OPERATION AT FULL SPEED.  OVER THE NEXT 5 DAYS CLEAN-UP PROCEEDED UNTIL ALL OF THE SHEEN ON THE RIVER HAD BEEN REMOVED AND ALL OF THE CONTAMINATED VEGETATION ALONG THE RIVER BANKS WAS PICKED UP FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.  WILD LIFE INCLUDING BIRDS AND FISH WERE MONITORED ALL DURING THE CLEAN-UP EFFORTS AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS FINAL REPORT.  NO EVIDENCE OF HARM TO WILDLIFE WAS FOUND.  COUNTRYMARK AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FINAL REPORT HAS COLLECTED 39 CUBIC YARDS OF OIL CONTAMINATED DEBRIS, INCLUDING ABSORBENTS, VEGETATION, AND FLOATING TIMBER.  CONTINUING INSPECTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN POSITIVE RESULTS AND WE HAVE NOT FOUND ADDITIONAL OIL OR OIL CONTAMINATED DEBRIS SINCE THE DATE OF THE ORIGINAL PRELIMINARY REPORT.    AT THE DATE AND TIME OF THE ORIGINAL REPORT COUNTRYMARK WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OR EXACT LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE LEAK BECAUSE OF EXTREMELY HIGH WATER IN THE RIVER AND IN THE BACKWATERS OF THE RIVER.  THE NECESSARY WORK SITE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO PIPELINE WORK CREWS FOR PIPELINE EXCAVATION AND INSPECTION WORK AT THE SUSPECTED LEAK LOCATION.  AS SOON AS THE WEATHER AND WATER CONDITIONS PERMITTED COUNTRYMARK INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL CAUSE AND LOCATION.  RESULTS OF THAT INVESTIGATION INDICATED THROUGH ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS SUBSTANTIATED BY FIELD EXAMINATION AND METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY (IMR TEST LABS), THAT A FATIGUE CRACK DEVELOPED CAUSING A SMALL LEAK.  A THIRD PARTY DIVE SURVEY DETERMINED THAT A CONTRIBUTING \"ROOT\" CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE WAS DUE TO AN EXPANDED SEGMENT OF THE PIPE BEING OUT IN THE CURRENT DUE TO EARTH MOVEMENT.  THE RECENT FLOODING HAD APPARENTLY CAUSED A WASHOUT OF THE RIVERBED ADJACENT TO THE FRACTURE LOCATION.  IT WAS INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE PIPELINE WEIGHT MOORINGS HAD BROKEN FROM THE PIPELINE, WHICH WOULD INCREASE BENDING LOADS\/STRESSES ON THE PIPE.

IN RESPONSE TO NOTIFICATION FROM THE PUBLIC AT 07:44 AM, PLAINS SHUT DOWN THE PIPELINE AND DISPATCHED A PIPELINE OPERATOR AT 07:47 AM. THE PIPELINE OPERATOR ARRIVED ON SITE AT 08:32 AM, IN WHICH HE CONFIRMED A RELEASE AND ISOLATED THE FAILED FITTING AND ASSOCIATED PIPING. DUE TO THE INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, RAIN CARRIED THE CRUDE OIL OFF THE PROPERTY AND INTO A DRAINAGE DITCH THAT DRAINS INTO AN UNNAMED TRIBUTARY OF LITTLE SILVER CREEK, APPROXIMATELY 0.6 MILES DOWN THE ROAD, THEN INTO HIGHLAND SILVER LAKE. IT WAS NOT UNTIL 10:42 AM, LOCAL TIME, THAT THE RELEASE WAS CONFIRMED TO HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND WAS A REPORTABLE INCIDENT. REMEDIATION AND MONITORING ACTIVITIES ARE ONGOING. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. A THIRD-PARTY METALLURGIST HAS BEEN CONTACTED TO EVALUATE THE FAILED FITTING. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED ONCE THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ARE RECEIVED. THE ACCIDENT WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY PLAINS TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) ON 7\/10\/2015 AT 11:10 INDICATING THE QUANTITY RELEASED AS UNKNOWN AND AN UNKNOWN VOLUME RELEASED IN WATER. NRC REPORT NUMBER 1122376 WAS ASSIGNED. THIS NRC REPORT WAS UPDATED ON 7\/12\/2015 AT 13:04 TO REFLECT 100 BBLS AS THE QUANTITY RELEASED AND AN UNKNOWN VALUE FOR THE VOLUME SPILLED IN WATER. NRC REPORT NUMBER 1122561 WAS ASSIGNED.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    BASED ON RESULTS OF MECHANICAL\/METALLURGICAL TESTING AND ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS, THE RELEASE INCIDENT APPEARS TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE ACCIDENTAL SEPARATION OF 1 STAINLESS STEEL TUBE FROM A SWAGELOK COMPRESSION FITTING IN THE DISCHARGE LINE OF GRAVITOMETER AT THE POCAHONTAS STATION.  THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES WERE INCONCLUSIVE AS TO THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE TUBING SEPARATION, THOUGH LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE TUBING MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE.  LOSS OF CONTAINMENT DUE TO EROSION IN DIKE AT THE STATION ALSO OCCURRED AND CONTRIBUTED TO INCIDENT.

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> ON JUNE 29, 2015, THERE WAS A FIRE AT THE VERTICAL PUMP STATION AT THE CLOVELLY DOME STORAGE TERMINAL.  THE FIRE OCCURRED WHILE A CONTRACT WELDER WAS PERFORMING STRUCTURAL WELDING TO REINSTALL STRUCTURAL STEEL AND GRATING.  THE CONTRACT WELDER AND DESIGNATED FIRE WATCH IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT.   LOOPS ONSITE FIRE BRIGADE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITH HAND HELD FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 17 MINUTES.  THE RESPONSE WAS LED BY LOOPS ONSITE FIRE BRIGADE WITH ASSISTANCE FROM CONTRACTORS, THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND LOCAL AMBULANCE SERVICE.   ALL APPROPRIATE PPE, INCLUDING FIRE RESISTANT CLOTHING, WAS WORN BY BOTH CONTRACTORS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT.      THIS INCIDENT DID RESULT IN ONE FIRST AID INJURY: THE CONTRACT WELDER SUSTAINED A MINOR FIRST DEGREE BURN TO HIS LOWER LEG.  HE WAS PROVIDED FIRST AID ON-SITE, WAS LATER EXAMINED BY A DOCTOR AND RELEASED TO RETURN TO FULL DUTY.  THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE MINIMIZED DAMAGE TO THE STRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA.    AN INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS COMMISSIONED CONSISTING OF LOOP EMPLOYEES AND A CONTRACTOR REPRESENTATIVE WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE INCIDENT.  THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS THE IGNITION OF HYDROCARBON VAPORS BY THE WELDING ARC OR HOT SLAG.  IT APPEARS THE WELDER PERFORMING WORK AT THE VERTICAL PUMP STATION UNKNOWINGLY LEANED INTO A 1\/2-INCH BALL VALVE WHICH WAS CONNECTED TO A 24-INCH PIPE CONTAINING CRUDE OIL.  BY LEANING INTO THE BALL VALVE HANDLE, THE VALVE WAS PARTIALLY OPENED CAUSING A RELEASE OF VAPOR AND CRUDE OIL UNDER A FIRE BLANKET THAT HAD BEEN PLACED OVER THE VALVE.",

MUD PLUGS WERE INSTALLED TO ISOLATE THE WORK AREA FROM ANY POTENTIAL VAPORS.  A PART OF THE MUD PLUG PROCEDURE REQUIRES AN OPEN VENT TO ENSURE NO PRESSURE BUILDS ON PIPING WHILE THE MUD PLUGS ARE IN PLACE.  A 4\" VALVE NEAR TANK 2660 WAS SELECTED TO PROVIDE THE VENTING.  OIL WAS RELEASED FROM THIS VALVE WHEN PRESSURE BUILT ON THE ASSOCIATED PIPING.  THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THIS SELECTED VENT LOCATION WAS NOT APPROPRIATE DUE TO A LOW PORTION OF THE PIPING FORMING A LIQUID TRAP BETWEEN THE MUD PLUG AND THE VENT.  THIS ALLOWED THERMAL PRESSURE BUILD UP BETWEEN THE VENT AND THE MUD PLUG WHICH CAUSED THE MUD PLUG TO FAIL.  AFTER THE MUD PLUG FAILED, WELDING ACTIVITIES CAUSED THE SUSPECTED IGNITION OF CRUDE OIL VAPORS INSIDE THE PIPE.  THIS CREATED PRESSURE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO FORCE CRUDE OUT OF THE 4\" VENT VALVE AT TANK 2660.    AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE COMBUSTION OF THE VAPORS INSIDE THE PIPE WAS NOT SUSPECTED, HENCE NRC NOTIFICATION WAS NOT MADE.  VIA THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PROCESS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT COMBUSTION OF VAPORS BEHIND THE MUD PLUG HAD LIKELY OCCURRED AND CAUSED THE RELEASE HOWEVER THE NRC REPORTING TIMELINE HAD ALREADY BEEN EXCEEDED.",

THE RELEASED CRUDE REACHED A CULVERT WHICH LEADS TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND, AS A RESULT, IMPACTED THE SHORELINE AND OCEAN WATER. THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE PIPE HAS BEEN EXCAVATED. THE AFFECTED PORTION OF PIPE WAS SECURELY PACKAGED TO PRESERVE ITS CONDITION AND HAS BEEN TRANSPORTED TO A SECURE, INDEPENDENT FACILITY FOR AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON RECEIPT OF THE THIRD PARTY, METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  IN THE MEANTIME, PLAINS PERSONNEL ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN CLEANUP AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION EFFORTS.    PART A. QUESTION 7. - 14:56 IS THE TIME OPERATOR NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC). THE NRC WAS FIRST NOTIFIED AT 12:43 BY AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY.   PART A. QUESTION 9. - ANSWER IS A BEST-ESTIMATE AS OF 6\/17\/2015.  PART A. QUESTION 11.- RESPONSE REFLECTS CURRENT ESTIMATE AS OF 6\/17\/2015. THE VOLUME OF RECOVERED COMMODITY WILL BE REVISED UPWARD IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.  PART A. QUESTION 17. -THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVACUATED FROM LOCAL STATE PARK CAMPSITES IS CURRENTLY UNDETERMINED AS NO ESTIMATES ARE INCLUDED IN THE INITIAL FIRST RESPONDER REPORTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  WE ARE INVESTIGATING THIS FURTHER AND WILL REVISE THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.     PART D. QUESTION 8. - ANSWER REFLECTS ESTIMATED COSTS INCURRED THROUGH 6\/16\/2015.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVES:    PART A, NUMBER 11 AND PART D, NUMBER 8 HAVE ALSO BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT NEW INFORMATION AS OF 7\/10\/2015.    AS OF 8\/4\/15 THE CURRENT ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME REMAINS APPROX. 2,400 BBLS.  PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE PURGE ACTIVITY ESTIMATES THE RELEASE COULD BE POTENTIALLY 3,400 BBLS.  WHILE PLAINS BELIEVES THE VOLUME ESTIMATE LISTED IN PART A, QUESTION 9 BEST REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL DISCHARGE VOLUME, WE ARE WORKING WITH AN OUTSIDE EXPERT TO RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES AND WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL UPDATES AS APPROPRIATE.    AS OF 11\/24\/2015, BASED ON THE WORK PERFORMED BY OUR INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT (I.E. THE 'OUTSIDE EXPERT' MENTIONED ABOVE), OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SPILL VOLUME IS 2,934 BARRELS.    THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PIPELINE SEGMENT INDICATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT AN AREA OF WALL THINNING FROM EXTERNAL CORROSION THAT ULTIMATELY FAILED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD UNDER THE IMPOSED OPERATING PRESSURE. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE EXTERNAL CORROSION OBSERVED ON THE PIPE SECTION IS CONSISTENT WITH CORROSION UNDER INSULATION FACILITATED BY WET-DRY CYCLING.  LINE 901 REMAINS SHUT DOWN AND SUBJECT TO CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER CPF NO. 5-2015-5011H AND AMENDMENTS. UPDATED COSTS FOR THE REPAIR AND RESTART OF THIS LINE REMAIN UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.     AS OF MARCH 8, 2017, PART D, NUMBER 5B HAS BEEN UPDATED FROM 500 BBLS TO 598 BBLS. FOLLOWING A DETAILED INVESTIGATION INTO THE VOLUME OF OIL RELEASED, EXPONENT, AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTING AND ENGINEERING FIRM RETAINED BY PLAINS, HAS CALCULATED THAT 598 BARRELS OF OIL FROM THIS RELEASE REACHED THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND ADJOINING SHORELINES.

UPON RECEIVING THE ALARMS, THE CONTROLLER CONTACTED THE FIELD OPERATOR AND SHUT DOWN THE STATION.  AT THE SAME TIME A ROSE ROCK FIELD SERVICES TRUCK DRIVER WAS UNLOADING ON LOCATION AT THE TRUCK RACK AND NOTICED A SMALL FIRE AT THE PUMP STATION.  THE TRUCK DRIVER CONTACTED THE SAME FIELD OPERATOR.  THE EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AND ISOLATED THE #2 PUMP AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE LOCATED AT THE PUMP STATION. THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 GALLONS OF CRUDE RELEASED FROM THE SEAL OF THE PUMP.   THERE WAS NO SOIL REMEDIATION REQUIRED AS THE VERY SMALL SPILL IGNITED AND BURNED.  THE PUMP WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND THE SPILL AREA WAS MINIMIZED TO WHAT HAD SPRAYED FROM THE SEAL FAILURE.    ROOT CAUSE BASED ON ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  AT 9:25 AM THE STATION DISCHARGE SET POINT HAD BEEN RAISED RFROM 1365 PSIG TO 1395 PSIG BY THE CONTROL CENTER TO INCREASE RATE ON THE PIPELINE. SINCE UNIT #2 WAS ALREADY AT MAXIMUM OUTPUT, THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE WAS ACHIEVED BY THE INCREASED SPEED OF UNIT #1 THROUGH THE PID CONTROL LOOP. AS A RESULT THE INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE BETWEEN THE PUMPS INCREASED FROM 750 PSIG TO 787 PSIG.     UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT, THE SEAL IN PUMP #2 WAS FOUND TO BE RATED TO 800 PSIG VERSUS THE 1000 PSIG AS DESIGNED.  THE SEAL WAS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED AS IT DID NOT MEET THE SPECIFICATION OF THE DESIGN BY COMPANY ENGINEERS. THE SEAL WAS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE.  THE VENDOR HAD FAILED TO INSTALL THE HIGHER RATED SEAL UPON BUILDING THE PUMP.     THE HIGHER SUCTION PRESSURE OF THE #2 PUMP ALONG WITH THE PUMP SEAL FLUSH CIRCUIT FINALLY OVERPRESSURED THE #2 PUMP TANDEM SEAL RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTAINMENT.  AS THE INCIDENT BEGAN TO UNFOLD, THE #2 PUMP THRUST-END PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SEALS WERE DAMAGED, RESULTING IN FRICTION AT THE PUMP SHAFT, HEAT AND THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE.  THE FIRE WAS IMMEDIATE UPON THE SEAL FAILURE.",

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 MST ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 17, 2015, THE BRIDGER PIPELINE LLC \"BRIDGER\" CONTROLLER WHO WAS OPERATING THE POPLAR LINE NOTICED A FLOW IMBALANCE ON HIS SCADA SCREEN AND BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE.  THE CONTROLLER NOTIFIED THE FIELD PERSONNEL OF A POSSIBLE ACCIDENT AND HAD FIELD PERSONNEL CHECK METERS TO ENSURE THEY WERE OPERATING CORRECTLY.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:40 AM MST  AN ALARM FOR A \"LEAK WARNING\" WAS RECEIVED.  THE CONTROLLER NOTIFIED THE ON CALL CONTROL CENTER SUPERVISOR AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION THEY BEGAN TO SHUT IN THE LINE AND AN AERIAL PATROL BEGAN MONITORING THE LINE SEGMENT. A PRESSURE DROP TEST CONFIRMED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS BETWEEN THE NORTH BLOCK VALVE AND THE SOUTH BLOCK VALVE.  MEANWHILE THE CONTROLLER, WORKING THROUGH THE LOCAL FIELD SUPERVISOR HAD FIELD PERSONNEL DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO INVESTIGATE AS WELL AS OTHER DOWNSTREAM RIVER ACCESS POINTS. DUE TO THE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ICE ON THE RIVER IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN A RELEASE TO WATER. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:49 AM MST THE LINE WAS SHUTDOWN. AT 3:58 PM MST AN NRC REPORT WAS MADE TO INDICATE A POSSIBLE RELEASE TO WATER. NRC REPORT NUMBER 1105930. LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WERE NOTIFIED AND THEY NOTIFIED MUNICIPAL WATER UTILITIES OF THE POTENTIAL CRUDE RELEASE. AT FIRST LIGHT ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 18, 2015, BRIDGER DISCOVERED AN OIL SHEEN IN OPEN WATER ON THE YELLOWSTONE RIVER APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE DOWNSTREAM FROM THE CROSSING AND 18 MILES DOWNSTREAM FROM THE PIPELINE CROSSING. BASED ON THE AERIAL REPORTS MADE TO BRIDGER, THE PREVIOUS NRC REPORT WAS UPDATED TO STATE THAT THERE WAS A RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL INTO THE YELLOWSTONE RIVER. THE NEW NRC REPORT NUMBER IS 1105969. THE RELEASE AMOUNT IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT 758 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WITH 65 BARRELS RECOVERED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNS OF WILDLIFE OR SOIL IMPACT. THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE ANALYSIS (RCFA) FOUND THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT TO BE NATURAL FORCE DAMAGE AS THE RIVERBED SCOURED AT THE CROSSING LEAVING THE PIPELINE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL FORCES OF THE RIVER. ACCORDING TO THE RCFA VORTEX INDUCED VIBRATIONS (VIV)  LIKELY DEVELOPED RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL STRESSES TO THE PIPELINE. THE ADDITIONAL STRESSES RESULTED IN A FATIGUE CRACK FORMING VERY QUICKLY. THE FATIGUE CRACK GREW TO FROM THE YELLOWSTONE RIVERBED SCOURING AWAY THE PIPELINE CROSSING. THE VIV RESULTED IN STRESSES TO THE PIPELINE AND A FATIGUE CRACK FORMED AT THE 11:05 O'CLOCK ORIENTATION. THE PIPELINE FAILED AFTER THE FATIGUE CRACK PROPAGATED. A DEPTH OF COVER SURVEY WAS COMPLETED IN 2011 AND 2012 AND BOTH INDICATED ADEQUATE COVER OVER THE PIPELINE CROSSING.",

CONTROL CENTER SHUT DOWN THE PUMP UNITS AND CLOSED MOTOR OPERATED VALVES AT MP 30 AND 55.  FIELD PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY AND WERE DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  HEAVY WEATHER IN THE AREA AT THE TIME HAMPERED THE FIELD INVESTIGATION.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 FIELD PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED CRUDE ON TETE BAYOU.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:44 THE FAILURE SITE WAS IDENTIFIED AND CONFIRMED.  AT 13:17 NRC REPORT NO. 1098151 WAS FILED.  SUBSEQUENT TO THIS NRC REPORT ANOTHER REPORT WAS FILED (1098153) AT 13:32 WITH AN UPDATED ESTIMATED VOLUME RELEASED.    UPON EXCAVATION A FAILURE OF THE PIPE BODY LOCATED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION OF UNKNOWN CAUSE WAS IDENTIFIED.  THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND PRESERVED FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS ON OCTOBER 20, 2014.  REPLACEMENT PIPE WAS INSTALLED ON THE SAME DATE.    ON OCTOBER 25,2014 THE LINE SEGMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY HYDROSTATICALLY PRESSURE TESTED FOR EIGHT (8) HOURS FROM MP 37.2 TO MP 62.8 PRIOR TO RESTART PER PHMSA ISSUED CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER (CAO).  PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 09:50 ON OCTOBER 26, 2014 UNDER A 20% REDUCTION IN OPERATING PRESSURE PER THE PHMSA ISSUED CAO.  LINE CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER THIS PRESSURE REDUCTION.     THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE PIPE SECTION RUPTURED AT A COLONY OF AXIALLY-ORIENTED AND INTERLINKED NEAR-NEUTRAL-PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKS THAT WERE LOCATED WITHIN AN AREA OF EXTERNAL CORROSION AT THE 6:00 ORIENTATION.",

KPL DISPATCHED LOCAL OPERATORS TO THE SITE.  THE PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER (\"PCC\") WAS NOTIFIED AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 AT 10:09.  LEAK DETECTION DID NOT INDICATE ANYTHING ABNORMAL WHILE THE LINE WAS RUNNING.  THE KPL OPERATORS WALKED THE AREA TO DETERMINE IF ANY CRUDE WAS ON OR WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE OPERATORS LAID DOWN ABSORBENT PADS, BUT DID NOT PICK UP ANY HYDROCARBONS ON THE PADS OR ON FOUR GAS METERS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE OPERATORS PROBED 12 TO 15 INCHES ON TOP OF THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE VISUAL INSPECTION DID NOT INDICATE A RELEASE.  A SAMPLE OF THE SURFACE SOIL WAS COLLECTED AND PROVIDED TO NAISMITH ENGINEERING (\"NEI\") TO SCREEN WITH A PHOTO-IONIZATION DETECTOR.  INITIAL SCREENING RESULTS OF THE SOIL SAMPLE INDICATED A HYDROCARBON READING OF APPROXIMATELY 700 PPM, BUT COULD NOT DIFFERENTIATE THE TYPE OF HYDROCARBON. BASED ON THE FIELD INSPECTIONS, PCC WAS CONTACTED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 AT 13:24 TO RESTART THE LINE.    NEI MOBILIZED TO THE SITE ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2014 TO COLLECT A FRESH SOIL SAMPLE DIRECTLY FROM THE IMPACTED AREA AND SUBMITTED THE SAMPLE FOR LABORATORY ANALYSIS. THE GOAL OF THIS SAMPLING WAS TO DETERMINE IF THE SOIL IMPACT WAS CAUSED BY CRUDE OIL (HANDLED BY KPL) OR A LIGHTER PETROLEUM PRODUCT SUCH AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL (NOT HANDLED BY KPL). THE LABORATORY RESULTS WERE RECEIVED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 AND INDICATED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS LIKELY CRUDE OIL AND NOT GASOLINE OR DIESEL.  KPL PERSONNEL EXCAVATED THE LINE AND A LEAK WAS CONFIRMED ON OCTOBER 2, 2014 AT 15:54.    THE PIPELINE REMAINS SHUTDOWN.",

THE SHEEN WAS REPORTED TO NRC AT 13:00 (REPORT NO. 1092192) THAT SAME DAY BY LOOP AS AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  LOOP PROMPTLY DISPATCHED RESOURCES TO THE AREA TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE.  LOOP NOTIFIED PHMSA THAT IT HAD CALLED NRC TO REPORT A SHEEN SPOTTED IN THE AREA OF THE LOOP RIGHT-OF-WAY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO ABOUT A MILE OFF THE BEACH AND THAT IT HAD SUSPENDED OPERATION OF ITS MAIN OIL LINE WHILE AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PIPELINE.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED OVER A FOUR DAY PERIOD.      ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 17, 2014, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE SHEEN WAS A 2.2 INCH LONGITUDINAL CRACK ACROSS THE WELD BETWEEN TWO JOINTS OF PIPE ON THE LOOP MAIN OIL LINE.  THE LINE WAS OFFICIALLY SHUTDOWN FOR REPAIR.  BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE CONCRETE ON THE PIPE IN THE AREA OF THE CRACK, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE CRACK WAS THIRD PARTY DAMAGE.   LOOP NOTIFIED PHMSA THAT EVENING OF THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION.    IN A DISCUSSION WITH PHMSA ON MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 2014, LOOP WAS ADVISED THAT A SECOND REPORT TO NRC WAS REQUIRED BY THE AGENCY IN ORDER FOR THE ACCIDENT TO BE LOGGED INTO THE PHMSA SYSTEM.  LOOP MADE A SECOND REPORT TO NRC AT 12:10 ON MONDAY, AUGUST 18, 2014 (REPORT NO. 1092665).     ONCE THE LEAK SOURCE WAS IDENTIFIED, LOOP IMMEDIATELY COMMENCED REPAIR OPERATIONS.   THE REPAIR PLAN ENTAILED THE FOLLOWING: REMOVING A PORTION OF THE CONCRETE COVER FROM THE TWO JOINTS OF PIPE; REMOVING THE SHRINK SLEEVE FROM THE WELD JOINT; DRILLING A 0.5 INCH HOLE AT EITHER END OF THE CRACK TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR PROPAGATION; AND, INSTALLING A PLIDCO CLAMP OVER THE CRACK AREA.  THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO FULL SERVICE ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 21, 2014.  LOOP HAD A VESSEL WITH OIL SPILL RESPONSE EQUIPMENT ON BOARD STANDING BY AT THE WORK SITE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR PERIOD.    AS INDICATED ABOVE, BASED UPON THE CONDITION OF THE CONCRETE ON THE PIPE IN THE AREA OF THE CRACK, IT APPEARED THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE CRACK WAS THIRD PARTY DAMAGE.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHEN THE DAMAGE COULD HAVE OCCURRED, LOOP RESEARCHED LA ONE CALL RECORDS FOR ANY NOTIFICATIONS MADE FOR THE AREA IN AND AROUND THE PIPELINE FOR 30 TO 60 DAYS PRIOR TO INCIDENT.

THE PLATFORM CONTINUED TO CONTACT NRC AND SPLC CONTROL ROOM IN ORDER TO SHUTDOWN THE PIPELINE.

INSPECTION OF THE LEAK SITE SHOWED THAT COATING DAMAGE FROM A REPAIR IN 2010 RESULTED IN A SMALL SECTION OF METAL BEING EXPOSED TO SEA WATER AT THE SPLASH ZONE OF THE RISER AROUND THE +12 LOCATION.  THE EXPOSURE, OVER TIME, RESULTED IN A PINHOLE LEAK DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION.  THE REASON THE CORROSION WAS NOT SPOTTED DURING ANNUAL PATROLS IS BECAUSE THE 8\" RISER WAS INSIDE A 16\" J-TUBE CASING.  REPAIR PROCEDURES ARE CURRENTLY BEING EVALUATED.

TO PROVIDE SURVEY SERVICES TO ASSIST USCG IN IDENTIFYING EXISTING PIPELINES IN THE AREA OF THE LEAK.    3\/17\/14 - TBS CREW MET WITH ES&H IN THE MORNING AND TRAVELED TO THE WORK SITE BUT WIND AND SEA CONDITIONS PREVENTED ANY SURVEY WORK.  3\/18\/14 - THE CREW RETURNED TO THE SITE WITH EH&S, USCG AND J&J DIVING AND PERFORMED THE FIELD WORK.  3\/19\/14 - TBS PROVIDED GIS INFORMATION FOR THE PIPELINE LOCATED IN THE AREA. IDENTIFYING THERE WAS ONLY ONE PIPELINE EXISTING NEAR THE STRUCTURE THAT RAN NORTH-SOUTH DIRECTION.  LEAK WAS LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE STRUCTURE.  HARVEST PIPELINE COMPANY (HPC) WAS CONTACTED BY USCG ABOUT A SMALL DISCHARGE IN BLACK BAY LOCATED AT 29 28 00.97 N -89 30 53.43 W.    3\/20\/14 - USCG BOOMED OFF AROUND A STRUCTURE NICKNAMED THE BIRDCAGE.  USCG DISCUSSED WITH HPC THEIR INTENTIONS REGARDING THE SITUATION AND HPC REPRESENTATIVES STATED THEY DIDNT BELIEVE IT WAS THEIR PIPELINE BUT WOULD PERFORM ANY REPAIRS NECESSARY TO STOP THE LEAK UNTIL THEY COULD PROVE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PIPELINE.  HPC SENT DOCUMENTATION AND GIS FILES TO SHOW THE LOCATION OF THEIR PIPELINE.  3\/21\/14 - HPC SENT DIVERS OUT TO THE LEAK LOCATION.  DIVERS REPAIRED THE LEAK WITH A CLAMP BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO LOCATE HPCS PIPELINE THAT DAY DUE TO DELAYS FROM BAD WEATHER. HPC HAD DIVERS ON STANDBY TO LOCATE HPCS LINE WHEN WEATHER PERMITTED.    3\/25\/14 - USCG INFORMED HPC OF A NEW SHEEN ON THE WATER.  HPC CONTRACTED THE DIVE CREW THAT WAS ON STANDBY FOR LOCATING HPCS PIPELINE TO INVESTIGATE THE SUSPECTED LEAK SOURCE AND PERFORM ANY NECESSARY REPAIRS AS SOON AS WEATHER PERMITTED.   3\/27\/14 - DIVERS REPLACED A PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED CLAMP, CYCLED THE HELIS FACILITY PUMPS AND OBSERVED NO FURTHER SHEENS.  HPC OPERATORS WERE ON-SITE AND REPORTED THERE WAS NO VISIBLE SHEEN OR SIGNS OF A LEAK IN THE AREA AFTERWARDS.  HPC CONTRACTED T. BAKER TO PERFORM A MAGNETOMETER\/JET PROBE SURVEY OF THE LINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  HPC DEPLOYED HARD AND SOFT BOOM AROUND THE LEAK SITE AND HAD PERSONNEL ON-SITE EVERY DAY UNTIL THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.  ALL SHEENS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT HAVE DISSIPATED.     3\/28\/14 - HPC WAS SERVED WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER FROM THE USCG.  HPCS EH&S MANGER RESPONDED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER SENDING A LETTER VIA EMAIL TO THE USCG.  HPC STATED THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE USCG SINCE LATE 2013 TO INVESTIGATE AND REPAIR AN INTERMITTENT LEAK IN BLACK BAY, LOUISIANA.  WHILE THE LINES OWNERSHIP WAS STILL NOT CLEAR, HPC HAS AND WOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PROTECT THE AREAS SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES.

PIPELINE SURVEY WORK WOULD CONTINUE WITH TBS AS WEATHER PERMITS. 4\/5\/2014 - HPC OPERATIONS ENGINEER REPORTED TO THE USCG AT APPROX. 10 AM THAT THE LEAK WAS BELIEVED TO BE HPCS BLACK BAY 8 PIPELINE BUT WAS WAITING FOR FINAL VERIFICATION FROM THE SURVEY CREW THAT WAS OUT THERE JETTING AND SURVEYING HPCS PIPELINE.  4\/7\/2014 - USCG REQUESTED HPC HOLD A REPAIR PLAN MEETING WITH THEM SOMETIME DURING THE WEEK OF THE 3\/7\/14.  A REPAIR PLAN WAS CREATED JUST IN CASE THE TBS DID CONFIRM THAT THIS WAS A HPC PIPELINE.   4\/8\/14 - A REPAIR PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO THE USCG BY THE OPERATIONS ENGINEER.  A CONFERENCE CALL MEETING WAS HELD WITH LDNR, USCG, HPC'S EH&S MANAGER, AREA OPERATIONS MANAGER, PIPELINE COMPLIANCE MANAGER AND OPERATIONS ENGINEER TO DISCUSS THE REPAIR PLAN.

WHEN THE STRUCTURE FILLED, SOME OIL WAS RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE OIL RAN INTO A NARROW (APPROXIMATELY TEN FOOT WIDE) PATH DOWN A HILL INTO A FARMERS FIELD, AND INTO A DRY, UNNAMED DRAINAGE. HILAND ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 475 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED, OF WHICH 375 BARRELS WERE RECOVERED FROM THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT STRUCTURE. APPROXIMATELY 100 BARRELS WERE RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. AT APPROXIMATELY 06:18 ON MARCH 20, 2014, HILAND CRUDE LLC CONTACTED ENVIRONMENTAL CREW (ABSORBENT & SAFETY SOLUTIONS) WHICH SOON ARRIVED ON SITE AND USED ABSORBENT MATERIALS AND BERMS TO STOP FURTHER MIGRATION OF THE CRUDE OIL. LATER THAT DAY ON MARCH 20, 2014 ABSORBENT BEGAN TO REMOVE CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE DRY DRAINAGE. HILANDS FIELD PERSONNEL WAS ABLE TO REPLACE THE FAILED 8 GARLOCK GASKET FROM BETWEEN (2) ASNI 600 FLANGES WITH A FLEXITALLIC CGI GASKET, THEY WERE ABLE TO PROPERLY TORQUE AND ALIGN ALL VALVES PROPERLY AND THE SYSTEM WAS RESTARTED AT 17:30 THAT EVENING. HILANDS FIELD PERSONNEL INSURED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS NOT FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE WITHIN THE GATHERING SYSTEM.  REMEDIATION OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL CONTINUED UNTIL MAY 2, 2014.  ON JULY 8, 2014 THE STATE INFORMED HILAND THAT THE MATTER HAD BEEN CLOSED. AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE HILANDS PERSONNEL DID NOT CONSIDER THIS PIPE SECTION JURISDICTIONAL. WHILE CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION OF THE RELEASE LOCATION IT WAS DETERMINE THAT THIS SECTION WAS JURISDICTIONAL AND WITHIN A _ MILE OF AN HCA, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED ON DISCOVERY TO THE NRC. EQUIPMENT FAILURES, BY THEIR VERY NATURE, ARE UNFORESEEABLE. HOWEVER, HILAND HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO PREVENT RELEASES TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE WHICH MAY OCCUR. THE CAMP CREEK FACILITY CURRENTLY IS OPERATED FROM A CONTROL CENTER, WHICH IS MANNED 24\/7. THE CONTROL CENTER, WHICH WAS NOT OPERATIONAL AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE AT ISSUE, MONITOR PRESSURE WHICH HAVE LOW AND HIGH PRESSURE ALARMS, AND FLOW METERS THAT ALSO HAVE ALARMS. THE CONTROL CENTER HAS THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. FIELD PERSONNEL ARE ON-SITE DURING THE DAY, AND THEY CHECK THE ASSETS PERIODICALLY DURING THE DAY. THERE ARE ISOLATION VALVES UPSTREAM OF THE STATION, WITHIN THE STATION, AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE STATION. THE FIELD PERSONNEL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN LOCAL PORTIONS OF THE STATION, AS THEY DID WHEN THE RELEASE AT ISSUE WAS DISCOVERED.",

AFTER A SEARCH OF THE AREA THE RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE HEBRON TO LIMA SEGMENT WAS CONFIRMED AT 01:02 ON 3\/18\/2014 BY LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL AT MP 807.     JUST PRIOR TO THE CALL INTO THE CONTROL CENTER FROM THE LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDER, A DELIVERY UPSTREAM OF THE HEBRON TO LIMA SEGMENT HAD BEGUN AT APPROXIMATELY 22:34 ON 3\/17\/2014.  THEREFORE, THE 20\" HEBRON TO LIMA SEGMENT WAS NOT RUNNING AND WAS UNDER STATIC PRESSURE AT TIME OF RELEASE CONFIRMATION.  AFTER RECEIVING THE CALL AND LEARNING OF THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE ODOR COMPLAINT THE CONTROL CENTER TOOK THE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE OF CLOSING THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM MOTOR OPERATED VALVES TO ISOLATE A SUB SEGMENT OF THE HEBRON TO LIMA SEGMENT BETWEEN MP 802 AND 808.

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> ONE-CALL TICKET #1381529934 WAS ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 11, 2013 BY FERGUSON CONSTRUCTION, A KINDER MORGAN CONTRACTOR. CPL PERSONNEL MARKED THE TWO CPL LINES IN A PLANTED COTTON FIELD. THE LEGACY MAPS OF THE LINES FAILED TO INDICATE THAT THE TWO LINES CROSSED IN THE FIELD, SO CPL PERSONNEL THOUGHT THAT THE TWO LINES WERE PARALLEL THROUGH THE FIELD. A KINDER MORGAN 8\" PIPELINE, ALSO LOCATED 10' TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CPL 6\" LINE AND DIRECTLY ABOVE THE CPL 8\" LINE WAS NEVER FLAGGED OR IDENTIFIED TO EITHER THE FERGUSON CREW OR CPL PERSONNEL. THE FERGUSON EXCAVATION CREW ARRIVED AT THE FIRST OF THE FLAGGED LINES ON JANUARY 30, 2014. CPL PERSONNEL WERE ON SITE AS THE FERGUSON CREW HAND DUG AROUND THE FIRST LINE. BASED ON THE MAP, THE CPL TECH EXPECTED THIS LINE TO BE THE CPL 8\" LINE.  HOWEVER, THIS WAS A 6\" PIPELINE.  THE FERGUSON CREW EXCAVATED AROUND THIS LINE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE CPL TECH INSTRUCTED THE CREW TO HAND DIG THE NEXT LINE UNTIL THE LINE WAS FULLY EXPOSED.  THIS LINE WAS ALSO A 6\" LINE. THE CPL TECH EXPECTED THIS TO BE THE 8\" CPL LINE.  HE BECAME ALARMED AND ORDERED THE CREW TO CEASE EXCAVATION UNTIL THE 8\" LINE COULD BE IDENTIFIED.  THE FERGUSON CREW COMPLIED AND SHUT DOWN THE TRACK-HOE.  THE FERGUSON CREW MOVED TO THE NORTH AND HAND DUG TO EXPOSE MORE OF THIS LINE, WHICH WAS AN 8\" LINE. THE CPL TECH BELIEVED THAT THIS 8\" PIPE WAS THE CPL LINE AND HE MARKED THIS LINE WITH PAINT AND FLAGS. THE EXCAVATING CREW MOVED NORTH TO THE 8\" LINE AND COMPLETED EXPOSING IT BY HAND DIGGING.  THE TRACK-HOE OPERATOR THEN COMPLETED THE EXCAVATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 8\" LINE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE CPL PIPELINE, LYING DIRECTLY UNDER THIS LINE, WAS NOT SEEN BY THE EXCAVATING CREW AT THIS POINT. THE TRACK-HOE OPERATOR MOVED TO REACH OVER THE EXPOSED 8\" LINE TO BEGIN REMOVING SOIL ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LINE. AS THE SOIL REMOVAL REACHED THE CPL 8\" LINE DEPTH, ABOUT 7' OF COVER, THE OPERATOR STRUCK THE CPL LINE AT AN ANGLE WITH THE TEETH ON THE CORNER OF THE TRACK-HOE BUCKET.  THIS ANGULAR STRIKE CAUSED AN IMMEDIATE PUNCTURE IN THE CPL LINE. THE CPL 8\" LINE WAS IN IDLE STATUS, WITH ONLY 80 PSIG BACK-PRESSURE ON THE LINE.  DUE TO THIS IDLE STATUS, THERE WAS NO LARGE SPRAY OF OIL. THE OIL FLOWED INTO THE 15' DEEP EXCAVATION AND WAS TOTALLY CONTAINED THERE.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO PERSONNEL, NO DAMAGE TO ANY EQUIPMENT, NO FIRE AND NO OVERLAND OIL FLOW. THE CPL TECH IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED CENTURION MANAGEMENT OF THE INCIDENT AND FOLLOWED THE PROPER RESPONSE PROCEDURES.  FROM PART G-17: THE TRACK HOE BUCKET TEETH SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED, AS WAS DONE AFTER THE LINE STRIKE. KINDER MORGAN WAS LISTED AS AN AFFECTED PARTY ON ALL OF THE ONE-CALL TICKETS, BUT NO ONE FROM KINDER MORGAN EVER RESPONDED TO MARK THEIR LINES OR TO NOTIFY CPL OR FERGUSON PERSONNEL THAT A KINDER MORGAN 6\" LINE WAS MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED WITH CPL FLAGS.",

IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE KROHNE METERS AT BOTH TANK 204 AND TANK 202 HAD ACQUIRED WAX AND REQUIRED CLEANING. ALL LEASES GOING TO THE VENTURA TANK FARM WERE SHUT DOWN UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE METERS WERE CLEANED.     AT 08:00 SUNDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2013, THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR, TWO PIPELINE OPERATORS, AN AUTOMATION & INTEGRATION SPECIALIST, AND VACUUM TRUCK DRIVER MET AT THE VENTURA TANK FARM TO COMPLETE THE CLEANING OF THE KROHNE METERS. ONLY ONE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS ON SHIFT AT THE TIME. THE FIELD OPERATORS FIRST COMPLETED THE METER AT TANK 204 WITH NO COMPLICATIONS BY 09:45. ONCE THE CLEANING OF THE METER AT TANK 202 HAD BEEN COMPLETED, THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE CONTROL CENTER FOR STARTUP. NO COUNTS WERE OBTAINED BY THE METER AND THE LINE TO TANK 202 WAS SHUT DOWN. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER NOTIFIED THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR THAT THE LINE WAS FLOWING AT A HIGH RATE. THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR SUGGESTED THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO A VOID IN THE LINE. THE LINE WAS THEN RESTARTED. THE METER CONTINUED TO NOT RECEIVE COUNTS AND THE OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR DECIDED TO COVER THE LINE WITH A PIPELINE OPERATOR. THE RELEASE AT TAYLOR LEASE WAS DISCOVERED AT 12:30.    DURING SPILL RESPONSE CLEANING, VALVE BV 1016 AT THE TAYLOR LEASE WAS FOUND DAMAGED INTO TWO PIECES. THE VALVE WAS A 125 SERIES LOCATED ON A 150 SERIES LINE AND WAS NOT PART OF THE VALVE MAINTENANCE LIST. PROTECTIVE DEVICE DRAWINGS AND PIPELINE INSTRUMENTATION DRAWINGS DID NOT IDENTIFY THE VALVE AS A 125 SERIES VALVE. THE LINE HAD OVER PRESSURED AND RELIEVED PRESSURE AT VALVE BV 1016. AFTER REVIEW OF THE ALARM LOGS, A HIGH HIGH PRESSURE ALARM OCCURRED AT 08:44 AT THE VENTURA MANIFOLD AND ANOTHER AT 10:04 ON THE TAYLOR LINE. ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, AT 10:56, A LOW LOW PRESSURE ALARM OCCURRED AT BOTH THE VENTURA MANIFOLD AND TAYLOR LINE. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THESE ALARMS AS AN ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITION AND WAS VIEWING IT AS AN ANOMALY AT THE TIME.     DURING CLEANING, VALVE V 1035 AND MOV 12 WERE CLOSED, HOLDING PRODUCT THROUGHOUT THE TAYLOR LEASE LINE. OVER TIME THE CRUDE OIL BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE THERMAL EXPANSION AND THE LINE BEGAN TO OVERPRESSURE DUE TO A RISE IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES. VALVE BV 1016 WAS A CAST IRON 125 SERIES VALVE AND WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THE 150 SERIES LINE. VALVE BV 1016 COULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE TO THAT DEGREE AND FAILED.     IN ADDITION, PRESSURE ALARMS RECEIVED BY THE CONTROL CENTER WERE NOT PROPERLY RECOGNIZED. THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER WAS UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE PATTERN OF ALARMS AS A LEAK TREND. POOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CONTROL CENTER CONTROLLER AND FIELD OPERATOR WAS PRESENT.",

THEIR INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE RELEASE ORIGIN TO BE FROM 1\/2\" DIAMETER STAINLESS STEEL TUBING ASSOCIATED WITH A THERMAL RELIEF.  THE RELEASE SOURCE WAS ISOLATED BY LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL WHEN A ONE INCH BALL VALVE WAS CLOSED. FOLLOWING INITIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITY AND DUE TO DARK CONDITIONS IN THE PREDAWN HOURS,  CONFIRMED DISCOVERY OF A REPORTABLE RELEASE MADE AT APPROXIMATELY 0500.

ONLINE NOTIFICATION TO THE NRC WAS ATTTEMPTED STARTING AT APPROXIMATELY 0630. THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE REPORT AFTER TWO ATTEMPTS SO TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS COMPLETED AT 0656 CDT.

THE PIPELINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN, A ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION WAS MADE AND EXCAVATION WAS PERFORMED TO EXPOSE THE BURIED FLANGE CONNECTIONS. AFTER A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF EACH EXCAVATED FLANGE CONNECTION, NO WEEP, LEAK OR OTHER SOURCE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE FLANGE CONNECTIONS WAS IDENTIFIED.    THE DISCHARGE PRESSURE TRANSMITTER, LOCATED JUST UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATED FLANGE CONNECTIONS, HAD BEEN DISPLAYING STEADY PRESSURE READINGS BELOW 1100 PSI FOR OVER 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE DISCOVERY. ONLY 3 MINOR PUMP ADJUSTMENTS HAD BEEN MADE DURING THAT 24 HOUR PERIOD.    FOR TWO DAYS AFTER THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN AND THE FLANGE CONNECTIONS EXPOSED, LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE A RELEASE POINT FOR THE CRUDE OIL DETECTED ON MARCH 31.  KOCH PIPELINE COMPANY, L.P. (KPL), THE OPERATOR, VERBALLY COMMUNICATED WITH THE PHMSA CENTRAL REGION OFFICE AND THE MINNESOTA OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY THAT THE PIPELINE SECTION WAS HOLDING PRESSURE AND NO SOURCE OF RELEASE WAS FOUND . A WRITTEN STARTUP PLAN FROM KPL WAS PRESENTED, DISCUSSED AND PHMSA CENTRAL REGION VERBALLY APPROVED THE STARTUP PLAN FOR KPL TO BEGIN ITS RESTART. THE PIPELINE WAS RESTARTED, FOLLOWING THE WRITTEN STARTUP PLAN. 36 HOURS LATER, DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS, DISCHARGE PRESSURE AT THE PUMP STATION WAS INCREASED TO 1275 PSI, WHEN LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL MONITORING THE EXCAVATED FLANGE CONNECTIONS IDENTIFIED A SMALL DRIP DURING CONTINUOUS FIELD MONITORING.  THE PIPELINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN. THE CRUDE OIL DRIP WAS DISCOVERED ON THE UNIT 5 BURIED DISCHARGE VALVE DOWNSTREAM FLANGE. THE HEADER WAS DRAINED UP. THE GASKET WAS REMOVED TO DISCOVER THE GASKET HAD FAILED. THE GASKET WAS REPLACED AND THE PIPELINE RESTARTED, AGAIN FOLLOWING THE APPROVED RESTART PLAN, TO SIMILAR PRESSURES IN THE VICINITY OF 1275 PSI WITHOUT ISSUE.  THE GASKET WAS SHIPPED TO KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES TO BE ANALYZED.     KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES PROVIDED THE FOLLOW CONCLUSION TO THEIR EXAMINATION, \"WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONCLUSIVELY IDENTIFY THE LEAK CAUSE BASED SOLELY UPON EXAMINATION OF THE DAMAGED GASKETS AFTER THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE JOINT.  HOWEVER, THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS OF THE GASKETS' SEALING SURFACES INDICATED BOTH A) INADEQUATE COMPRESSION AND B) UNEVEN COMPRESSION.  THESE CONDITIONS SUGGEST MISALIGNMENT OF THE FLANGE FACES, OR UNEVEN OR INADEQUATE BOLT TORQUE DURING INSTALLATION, OR BOTH.  THE FLANGE ALIGNMENT WAS CHECKED WHEN THE GASKETS WERE REPLACED AND IT WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN THE TOLERANCES OF KOCH'S FLANGE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE, EFFECTIVELY RULING OUT FLANGE MISALIGNMENT AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.\"",

UPON ARROVAL HE COULD SEE OIL LEAKING FROM THE END OF THE PUMP. HE IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE STATION LOCALLY TO STOP FLOW AND NOTIFIED THE CONTROL CENTER, EHS AND AREA FOREMAN. OIL LEAKING FROM PUMP WAS RUNNING FROM THE NORTH END OF THE STATION TO SOUTHEAST CORNER FOLLOWING ELEVATION AND WAS GATHERING IN CONTAINMET BERM ALREADY IN PLACE. STATION OPERATOR CALLED FOR VACUUM TRUCKS TO BE DISPATCHED TO SITE WHILE AREA FOREMAN DISPATCHED LOCAL PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO SITE. FOREMAN ARRIVED ON SITE AT 3:10 PM DID HAZARD ASSESSMENT, PERFOMED LOTO  THEN DIRECTED VAC TRUCKS AND COMPANY PERSONNEL TO PICK UP OIL FROM DIKED AREA. FROM TIME OF DISCOVERY TO WHEN BACKUP ARRIVED TO DO HAZ ASSESSMENT, OIL THAT HAD LEAKED CONTINUED TO COLLECT IN SE CORNER OF PROPERTY AND SMALL AMOUNT DID TRICKLE OVER TOP OF BERMS APPROXIMATELY 14.4 BBLS LEFT SITE IN A 90 FT X 36 FT AREA. DURING CLEANUP MECHANIC DETERMINED SPILL CAME FROM A CRACKED LINER\/PISTON END CAP ON GASO PD PUMP. UPON DISASSEMBLY MECHANIC FOUND THAT RETAING NUT ON PISTON ROD HAD LOOSENED AND IN DOING SO BEGAN TO CONTACT END CAP CRACKING IT. THE RETAINING NUT IS RETAINED ALSO BY A COTTER PIN THAT PASSES THROUGH HOLE IN ROD AND NOTCHES MANUFACTURED IN RETAINING NUT. ONLY A SMALL SLIVER OF THE COTTER PIN WAS FOUND. NEW PISTON ROD, PISTON NUT, RETAINING NUT, AND COTTER PIN WERE INSTALLED ALONG WITH NEW \"END CAP\" TO REPLACE ONE CRACKED.   BY 8PM 1\/17\/13 350 BBLS OIL HAD BEEN PICKED UP AT SITE AND IMPACTED SOILS HAD BEEN PILED AWAITING DETERMINATION OF REMEDIATION AREA. PUMP WAS REPAIRED BY THIS TIME ALSO AND RESTARTED AND MONITORED. ON 1\/18\/13 LOCAL PERSONNEL CONTINUED TO REMOVE IMPACTED SOILS AROUND PUMPS AND PIPING AND ALSO MOVED IMPACTED SOIL PILE FROM NIGHT BEFORE TO REMEDIATION SITE AGREED TO WITH LANDOWNER. BY MID AFTERNOON KDHE HAD BEEN ON SITE TO APPROVE CLEANUP. ALSO ON 1\/18\/13 AT 5:30 PM PHMSA INSPECTOR MET WITH JIM WILSON AND DARYL CRAM AT SPILL SITE AND INSPECTED PARTS FROM ASSOCIATED PUMP AT KAW'S RUSSELL OFFICE. PHMSA INSPECTOR ALSO REVISTED HOLZINGER STATION THE FOLLOWING DAY ON 1\/19\/13 WITH LOCAL OPERATING PERSONNEL GIVING HIM ACCESS TO SITE.   SPILL ESTIMATE IS 391.8 BBL RECOVERED 350 BBL WITH 41.8 BBL RETAINED IN SATURATED SOILS.   INVESTIGATION INTO COTTER PIN FAILURE, RETAINING NUT LOOSENING, ETC. IS ONGOING.      NRC WAS NOT NOTIFIED BECAUSE OPERATOR DID NOT FEEL IT MET CRITERIA IN 195.52 (NO DEATH, NO FIRE, ESTIMATED COST OF CLEANUP AND DAMAGES WOULD BE LESS THAN $50,000, WAS NOT ON WATER.

STATION OPERATOR TOLD CONTROLLER \"DON'T SHUT DOWN THE BOOSTER AS LINE WILL SET UP AND WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET MOVING AGAIN IF LOW GRAVITY OIL, COMES TO A STOP IN THE 6\" LINE.  CONTROLLER AGREED AND CONTINUED PUMPING WITH BOOSTER PUMP. CONTROLLER DID NOT RECOGNIZE THERE WAS ALSO A DROP IN STATION DISCHARGE PRESSURE 13 MINUTES BEFORE HIGH SUMP ALARM RECEIVED. CONTROLLER DID NOT NOTIFY CONTROL ROOM SUPERVISOR. AT 07:00  CONTROLLER WORKING DAY SHIFT ARRIVED AND DURING SHIFT TURNOVER, SITUATION AT TALOGA STATION WAS EXPLAINED AND GONE OVER. HE TOO ACCEPTED THE DIRECTION OF THE STATION OPERATOR TO NOT SHUT DOWN THE BOOSTER OR LINE MAY BECOME PLUGGED AND CONTINUED TO RUN BOOSTER PUMP.   BECAUSE OF A FLAT TIRE AND A HEAVY SNOW STATION OPERATOR DID NOT ARRIVE AT STATION UNTIL 09:10. UPON ARRIVAL HE COULD SEE OIL ON THE PUMP BUT NO WHERE ELSE AS ENTIRE STATION WAS COVERED IN A BLANKET OF HEAVY SNOW.  HE IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED PUMP BY CLOSING SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES OF THE PUMP TO STOP FLOW OF OIL COMING FROM THE \"STUFFING BOX\" OF  PUMP P-2. STATION OPERATOR NOTIFIED RELIEF AREA FOREMAN WHO STARTED DISPATCHING  PERSONELL AND EQUIPMENT TO SITE AND NOTIFIED EHS. FOREMAN NOTIFIED MAINTENANCE SUPT WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED ME. UPON INVESTIGATION  THE SPILL WAS CAUSED BY THE THREADED PACKING GLAND BEING PUSHED OUT ALLOWING OIL TO FLOW INTO STUFFING BOX AND TO SUMP.  IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THE SPILL BECAUSE OF SNOW COVER. CREW WORKED INTO THE NIGHT AND ALL THE NEXT DAY TO PICK UP FREE OIL AND ANY SATURATED SOILS FROM SITE.

THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN SHUT SINCE BEFORE MIDNIGHT SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 2012 AFTER A LOSS IN PRESSURE  WAS IDENTIFIED ON THE SYSTEMS  SCADA.  THE LA STATE POLICE HAZMAT  HOT LINE,  NRC,  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND OTHER AGENCIES WERE  NOTIFIED.  THE OIL FROM THE NORTH LINE CRUDE PIPELINE WAS CONTAINED IN THE IMMEDIATE  AREA AND RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE INITIATED USING VACUUM TRUCKS, SKIMMERS AND ABSORBENT MATERIALS TO RECOVER  THE OIL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. AIR QUALITY MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE IMPACTED AREA AND CONFIRMED NO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC.  THE CLEANUP WAS COORDINATED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE LOUISIANA OIL SPILL RESPONSE COORDINATORS OFFICE, THE LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE AFFECTED PIPE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A THIRD PARTY LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS AS PART OF A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,891 BARRELS OF OIL WAS PROVIDED TO REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  ONCE THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE, THE SPILL VOLUME ESTIMATE  AND RECOVERED AMOUNT WILL BE UPDATED.  TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED.  THE NORTH LINE   PIPELINE ORIGINATES IN ST. JAMES, LOUISIANA AND CARRIES CRUDE OIL TO THE NORTHERN PART OF LOUISIANA.  CUSTOMERS  WERE BEEN NOTIFIED AND EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY TO MINIMIZE  ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS.    METALLURGICAL AND MECHANICAL TESTING REVEALED THAT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT NAMELY, AN INTERNAL HOOK CRACK ADJACENT TO THE SEAM WELD WAS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE RUPTURE.   ELEMENT REACHED ITS CONCLUSION BASED UPON: VISUAL EXAMINATION, ULTRASONIC TESTING, METALLOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION, HARDNESS TESTS, CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, TENSION TESTS, AND CHARPY TESTS.  VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE REVEALED A SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE ALONG THE INSIDE HALF OF THE FRACTURE FOR A LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES, STARTING APPROXIMATELY 6-1\/2 INCHES FROM THE GIRTH WELD.   THE FLAT FRACTURE WAS PERPENDICULAR TO THE PIPE SURFACES AND TRANSITIONED TO THE SLANTED FRACTURE [FEATURE] FOR THE REMAINING 2-1\/2 INCHES TO THE GIRTH WELD.   THE FRACTOGRAPHY INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE INITIATED IN THE SMOOTH, FLAT FRACTURE AND PROPAGATED IN BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM DIRECTIONS. THE CURVED PATH OF THE FRACTURE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF A HOOK-CRACK DEFECT.  THE DEPTH OF THE HOOK CRACK WAS 0.11 INCH, APPROXIMATELY 35-PERCENT OF THE NOMINAL WALL THICKNESS.  IN SUM, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE 2012 RUPTURE OF THE AFFECTED PIPELINE WAS A 35-PERCENT THROUGH-WALL HOOK-CRACK MANUFACTURING DEFECT ADJACENT TO THE PIPE SEAM.        PART: A  9. ESTIMATED VOLUME OF COMMODITY RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY (BARRELS): 2,880  11. ESTIMATED VOLUME OF COMMODITY RECOVERED (BARRELS): 2,000    PART H - NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT **  THE COMMODITY RECOVERED FIGURE IN ITEM 11. IS A GROSS ESTIMATE BASED OFF OF THE VOLUME OF COMMODITY RELEASED (2,880.00 BARRELS).  EMPCO RECOVERED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMODITY RELEASED DURING THE INCIDENT RESPONSE EFFORTS, AS RECOGNIZED BY THE UNIFIED INCIDENT COMMAND'S FINAL SITE TOUR AND DETERMINATION THAT CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS WERE COMPLETE ON MAY 15, 2012.   APPROXIMATELY 1,200 BARRELS OF PRODUCT WERE RECOVERED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT AND HAULED OFFSITE BY VACUUM TRUCK.  A LARGE, BUT UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF OIL WAS RECOVERED THROUGH EXCAVATION AND DEBRIS REMOVAL AND HAULED OFF IN ROLL-OFF BOXES (407 BOXES WITH APPROXIMATELY 3,129 TONS OF OILED VEGETATION, OILED TRASH, AND OILED DIRT).  EVAPORATION WOULD LIKELY ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ITEM 9. AND ITEM 11.",

SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    THE 12 INCH BOA PIPELINE OPERATES INTERMITTENTLY TO MAKE SCHEDULED DELIVERIES OF CRUDE OIL.  ON MARCH 17, 2012, A STARTUP OF THE PIPELINE OCCURRED AT 0700.  WHEN A NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE WAS NOT ACHIEVED UPON STARTUP OF THE PIPELINE, THE PLAINS CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE PIPELINE (0705)  FIELD PERSONNEL WERE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED BY THE CONTROL ROOM WHO ARRANGED FOR AN OVER FLIGHT OF THE PIPELINE RIGHT-OF-WAY TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE NORMAL PRESSURE.  THE OVER FLIGHT BEGAN AS SOON AS FOG IN THE AREA LIFTED.      AT APPROXIMATELY 1000, AN OIL SHEEN WAS OBSERVED IN BARATARIA PASS AND APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE JACK UP LIFT BARGE SEVEN INAGHA WHICH WAS SPUDDED DOWN AND THE DREDGE VESSEL DREDGE TEXAS OWNED BY THE GREAT LAKES DREDGE AND DOCK COMPANY.  AN INSPECTION OF THE AREA CONDUCTED THE PREVIOUS DAY, DID NOT NOTE THE LIFT BARGE OR DREDGE IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE. AFTER OBSERVING THE OIL SHEEN, NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO PLAINS MANAGEMENT, USCG AND LOUISIANA STATE POLICE HAZ MAT.  CONTRACTORS WERE CONTACTED TO BEGIN MOBILIZING TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE.  A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WAS ALSO CONTACTED TO INVESTIGATE THE OIL SLICK WHICH APPEARED TO BE EMANATING NEAR OR AROUND THE JACK UP VESSEL.    A MAGNETOMETER SURVEY SHOWED THE 12-INCH BOA PIPELINE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 600 FEET OFF OF THE LIFT BARGE SEVEN INAGHA PORT SIDE AND NORTH OF THE VESSEL.  MULTI SCANNING OF THE SEA BOTTOM INDICATED NO EVIDENCE THAT THE SEVEN INAGHA SPUDS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PIPELINE.  THE CAPTAIN OF SEVEN INAGHA DID NOT NOTIFY ONE-CALL, BUT DID NOTIFY THE USCG WHEN A SHEEN WAS OBSERVED AROUND HIS VESSEL.    FROM THE MULTI SCAN IMAGING AND OTHER INVESTIGATION DATA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DREDGE VESSEL DREDGE TEXAS STRUCK THE BOA 12-INCH PIPELINE WITH ITS CUTTER HEAD WHEN IT WAS LOWERED TO HELP STOP THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE DREDGE TO CONDUCT MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.  SEA BOTTOM IMAGES CLEARLY SHOW THE CRATER FORMED BY DROPPING THE CUTTER HEAD INTERSECTING THE PIPELINE ALIGNMENT.  THE DREDGE WAS FOUND ANCHORED ABOVE THE PIPELINE.  A PLAINS PIPELINE MARKER IDENTIFYING A PIPELINE CROSSING AND WARNING DO NOT ANCHOR OR DREDGE WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE TO DREDGE TEXAS.  DREDGE TEXAS DID NOT MAKE A ONE-CALL NOTIFICATION FOR DREDGING ACTIVITIES IN THE LOCATION WHERE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED.    APPROXIMATELY 204 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL WAS RELEASED AND SIX FEET OF THE PIPELINE WAS DAMAGED.  TO REPAIR THE PIPE, A CLAMP DEVICE WAS CONSTRUCTED TO SUPPORT THE DAMAGED PIPE IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE LIFTED TO A HEIGHT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE REPAIRS.  UPON REMOVAL OF THE CLAMP IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE DAMAGE WAS A RESULT OF THE CUTTER HEAD.  THE DAMAGE BEGAN AT THE 12 OCLOCK POSITION CONTINUING TO THE SIX OCLOCK POSITION, RIPPING OPEN AND ALMOST COMPLETELY SEVERING THE PIPELINE.

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> AFTER THE START UP (08:05 ON 1\/27) OF A SHIPMENT OF CRUDE OIL OUT OF TANK C7 THE LOCAL OPERATOR OBSERVED CRUDE OIL COMING OUT OF THE LEVER LOCK CHECK VALVE DOWNSTREAM OF THE TANK BOOSTER PUMP. THE BOOSTER PUMP IS LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE TANK INSIDE THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT OF THE TANK. THE LOCAL OPERATOR ENTERED THE LOCAL BUILIDING AND, USING THE LOCAL HMI, EXECUTED AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN OF THE THE DELIVIERY. ONCE THE CONTROL CENTER WAS NOTIFIED THE LOCAL OPERATOR WALKED DOWN TO THE BOOSTER AREA AND CLOSED MANUALLY OPERATED VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LEAKING CHECK VALVE ISOLATING IT AND STOPPING THE DISCHARGE OF OIL.   THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ON MARCH 10, 2011, DURING THE REPLACEMENT OF A 16\"  TANK VALVE, THE BOOSTER PUMP HAD BEEN USED TO LOWER THE OIL LEVEL BELOW THE NOZZLE ELEVATION. MAINTENANCE CREWS TRIED TO THROTTLE THE DISCHARGE VALVE AS THE OIL LEVEL APPROACHED THE LOW SUCTION SO THE BOOSTER WOULD NOT SUCK AIR AND LOOSE ITS PRIME. AT SOME POINT THE BOOSTER PUMP DID SUCK AIR AND LOST ITS PRIME. IN AN EFFORT TO RE-PRIME THE PUMP IT WAS ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE LEVER LOCK CHECK VALVE AND LET THE DISCHARGE PIPE BACKFLOW INTO THE PUMP BODY. THERE WAS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ON THE LEVER LOCK CHECK VALVE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PULL THE HANDLE ON THE LEVER. AFTER EXERTING SOME EFFORT THE TWO SET BOLTS ATTACHING THE LEVER LOCK SHAFT TO THE CHECK FLAPPER COLLAR SHEARED OFF AND THE HANDLE WENT LIMP.   THE DISTRICT MANAGER HAD COME UP TO CASPER TO ASSIST WITH THE VALVE REPLACEMENT AND WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE HANDLE ON THE LEVER LOCK WAS BROKEN.THE DISTRICT MANAGER ASSUMED THAT THE ONLY IMPLICATION WAS THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LEVER LOCK HAD BEEN LOST BUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE VALVE WAS NOT COMPROMISED. THE VALVE STAYED IN THIS STATE UNTIL IT FAILED, CAUSING THIS INCIDENT. THE BOOSTER PUMP HAD BEEN USED MULTIPLE TIMES (57) SINCE MARCH 10.   IN FACT THE DESIGN OF THE LEVERLOCK CHECK VALVE DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER MECHANICAL MEANS TO KEEP THE SHAFT OF THE LEVER LOCK HANDLE ENGAGED WITH THE CHECK VALVE FLAPPER AND INTACT WITHIN THE BODY OF THE CHECK VALVE. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT CAUSED THE SHAFT TO EXIT THE VALVE BODY ON THIS DATE.",

UPON ARRIVAL APPROX. 50 MINUTES AFTER NOTIFICATION AREA STATION OPERATOR CONFIRMED SPILL WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE HILL CITY TO BEMIS 8\" PIPELINE AT THIS TIME ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE ARRIVING ON SITE AND THEY BEGAN DEFENSIVE MEASURES TO KEEP OIL FROM SPREADING. AREA FOREMAN HAD DISPATCHED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS WITH SPILL RESPONSE TRAILERS AND EXCAVATION EQUIPMENT WHEN HE WAS INFORMED OF LOCATION OF PRESUMED SPILL AND ITS PROXIMITY TO THE RIVER. STATION OPERATOR CLOSED NEAREST (1 _ MILES) UPSTREAM BLOCK VALVE AND DOWNSTREAM BLOCK VALVE AT BEMIS STATION (3\/4 MILE).  AS PERSONNEL AND VACUUM TRUCKS ARRIVED, OIL AND MUD ON THE SURFACE WAS PICKED UP. EXCAVATION OF PIPELINE BEGAN AND LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE COMING FROM WHERE THE 8\" OD HIGH CARBON PIPE HAD BEEN TRANSITIONED TO 8.625\" OD ERW LINE PIPE WHEN NEW RIVER CROSSING WAS INSTALLED BY HDD REPLACING AN OLD OVERHEAD SPAN EARLIER IN 2011. TRANSITION WAS MADE USING A MACHINED PIECE MADE FROM .500 WALL PIPE. 8\" OD PIPE HAD HAIRLINE CRACK IN THE HEAT EFFECTED ZONE ALONG THE BOTTOM 1\/3 OF PIPE. LINE WAS DRAINED AND NEW PIPE AND TRANSITION WAS INSTALLED. CLEAN UP CONTINUED NON-STOP THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND INTO NEXT DAY. IMPACTED SOILS FROM THE SURFACE WERE EXCAVATED AND MOVED TO REMEDIATION SITE STARTED NEARBY.   BASED ON SIZE OF SURFACE AREA IMPACTED SPILL WAS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED AT 30 TO 40 BBLS WITH RECOVERY OF 10 BBLS. AS WE BEGAN MORE EXCAVATION IN THE LEAK SITE HOLE, (SOIL IS ALMOST PURE SAND), ITSELF HOPING TO GET THE OK FROM KDHE TO BACKFILL THE SITE WE FOUND THAT AT 7 FEET GROUNDWATER BEGAN FLOWING INTO EXCAVATION AND MORE OIL WITH IT.  TRUCKS WERE BROUGHT IN TO PICK UP ALL OIL AND IMPACTED WATER.  THE SAND HAD ALLOWED THE OIL TO EASILY REACH THE SHALLOW GROUNDWATER AND WHILE IT DID KEEP IT FROM GOING ANY DEEPER IT ALLOWED IT TO SPREAD IMPACTING A LAYER OF SOIL 10\" TO 18\" THICK AT THE ELEVATION OF THE GROUNDWATER. EXCAVATION HAS BEEN ONGOING NEARLY EVERY DAY SINCE THE SPILL TO ASSURE ALL OF THIS LAYER OF IMPACTED SOIL IS REMOVED AND ANY FREE OIL ON TOP OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER IS RECOVERED. TO DATE AREAS EAST, SOUTH, NORTH OF SPILL SITE HAVE BEEN CLEARED AND KDHE HAS ALLOWED US TO BEGIN BACKFILLING THESE AREAS. AREAS TO THE WEST ARE STILL BEING EXCAVATED BUT BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE SITE EXCAVATION IS EXPECTED TO BE DONE EARLY NEXT WEEK. WITH ALL THIS INFO WE NOW ESTIMATE THAT APPROX. 150 BBLS WERE SPILLED AND APPROX. 100 BBLS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

THE EMPLOYEE #2 ADVISED HIM NO AND AT THAT TIME EMPLOYEE #1 LOOKED AT HIS SECURITY MONITOR AND OBSERVED A LARGE LEAK IN THE MANIFOLD. EMPLOYEE #1 IMMEDIATELY STARTED SHUTTING EVERYTHING DOWN AND CLOSING VALVES. WHEN THE LEAK WAS DUG OUT IT WAS DISCOVERED THE LINE THAT WAS LEAKING WAS THE 8 INCH SHELL LINE AND NOT THE 22 INCH GREEN LINE THAT THE DELIVERY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOING TO.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE SHUT DOWN DID NOT SHUT THE PUMP DOWN NOR DID THE STATION INDICATE ANY HIGH PRESSURE ALARMS DURING THE 15 MINUTE TIME SPAN THAT THE PUMP WAS RUNNING. IN LOOKING AT THE DATA AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE SHOWED TO REACH 137 PSI. THE HIGH PRESSURE SHUT DOWN ON THE PUMP IS 271 PSI. THE PUMP PRESSURE SHUTDOWN WAS TESTED AND FOUND TO BE WORKING CORRECTLY. ALSO THE MANIFOLD WAS NOT LABELED DUE TO RECENTLY BEING PAINTED. OPERATIONS WAS IN THE PROCESS OF RE-LABELING THE MANIFOLD. THE GREEN LINE VALVE AND THE SHELL LINE VALVE ARE SIDE BY SIDE, BUT THE GREEN LINE VALVE IS A 10 INCH MOV AND THE SHELL LINE IS A 6 INCH MANUAL OPERATOR VALVE. THERE WAS NOT A PROCEDURE FOR A LINE WASH FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST. AFTER EXCAVATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LINE HAD A SPLIT DOWN THE SEAM OF THE PIPE APPROXIMATELY 49 INCHES IN THE 3 OCLOCK POSITION. THE PIPE WILL BE CUT OUT AND SENT FOR ANALYSIS.    UPDATE 1\/18\/2012 - UPDATED FINAL COST.  LAB REPORT ON PIPE AND INCIDENT REPORT CONCERNING THIS LEAK WAS FORWARDED TO PHMSA ON 6\/20\/2011.    PART G5, PART 2 - OTHER - THE CAUSE OF FAILURE WAS OVERHEATING OF THE EDGES OF THE SKELP DURING THE LAP WELDING PROCESS CAUSING GAIN GROWTH AND INTERGRANULAR CRACKS.  THE SERVICE CONDITIONS OF THE PIPE CAUSED THE CRACKS TO CONNECT OVER TIME AND EVENTUALLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE WALL THICKNESS OF THE PIPE TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE HOOP STRESS.",

THE RELEASE WAS IN A CONTAINED AREA AND DID NOT THREATEN WATER OR ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. THE RELEASE DID NOT CAUSE ANY FIRE OR PERSONAL INJURIES. NO PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF CENTURION CONTROLLED PROPERTY WAS IMPACTED BY THIS RELEASE.  AFTER IMMEDIATE AND CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT OF THE RELEASE, CENTURION PROPERLY NOTIFIED THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION, NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, PHMSA, AND EPA.  FURTHER, CENTURION HAD AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (\"ERP\") IN PLACE AND APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS OF THE ERP PROCEDURES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT. UPON DISCOVERY OF THE RELEASE, CENTURION EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY ASSESSED THE SITUATION, VERIFIED NO POTENTIAL TO IMPACT SENSITIVE AREAS, ATTEMPTED TO MITIGATE FURTHER RELEASE BY STOPPING THE FLOW OF OIL, AND RESPONDED WITH QUICK CLEAN-UP OF THE AREA BY DEPLOYING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESPONSE RESOURCES.  IN ADDITION, CENTURION CONDUCTED A TAP ROOT INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT.  AN OUTSIDE METALLURGIST ALSO ANALYZED THE HINGE PIN ASSEMBLY ON THE JENSEN MIXER.  BOTH DETERMINED THAT EQUIPMENT FAILURE WAS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE HINGE PIN MECHANISM ON A JENSEN MIXER HAD FAILED, CAUSING A SEPARATION OF THE MIXER FROM THE TANK.     IN ACCORDANCE WITH CENTURION POLICY, AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED. CENTURION IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN ALL JENSEN MIXERS WITH SUSPECTED HINGE PIN MECHANISMS.   CENTURION IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL JENSEN MIXERS THAT USE THE SAME HINGE PIN MECHANISM AS THE ONE FOUND ON TANK 6688.  CENTURION IS NOT RESTARTING ANY JENSEN MIXER THAT HAS NOT HAD THE PIN ASSEMBLY REPLACED.  IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE, CENTURION REVIEWED ALL RELEVANT OPERATIONS, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF OPERATING PROCEDURES THAT IMPACT STORAGE TANKS AND CONTROL ROOM OPERATIONS.  ALTHOUGH NOT A ROOT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT, BASED ON THIS REVIEW, CENTURION ENHANCED CERTAIN PROCEDURES IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT THE POTENTIAL VOLUME OF CRUDE OIL THAT COULD BE RELEASED FROM TANKAGE.",

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> ON JULY 26, 2010, ENBRIDGE CONFIRMED A MAINLINE RUPTURE ON LINE 6B AT MP608.2452.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A SCHEDULED PIPELINE SHUTDOWN.  AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT PHMSA ISSUED A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER THAT ORDERED THE PIPELINE TO REMAIN SHUT DOWN UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN THE CAO WERE SATISFIED.  ENBRIDGE SATISFIED ALL CONDITIONS OF THE CAO AND RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM PHMSA TO RESUME OPERATIONS ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2010 AT WHICH TIME ENBRIDGE SUCCESSFULLY RESTARTED THE LINE.      OF FURTHER NOTE, WHILE THE TELEPHONIC REPORT TO THE NRC IS STATED AS 13:33 ON JULY 26, 2010, ENBRIDGE MADE A CALL TO NRC AND WAS ON HOLD FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  ENBRIDGE THEN HUNG UP THE CALL AND CALLED AGAIN AT WHICH TIME IT WAS ON HOLD FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF TIME.  THE STATED 13:33 REFLECTS THE TIME THAT ENBRIDGE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE VERBAL NOTIFICATION OF THE INCIDENT.    THE RELEASE WAS INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT 19,500 BARRELS OF WHICH AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT ENTERED THE TALMADGE CREEK AND ULTIMATELY THE KALAMAZOO RIVER.  THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED PRODUCT RELEASED IN OR REACHING WATER HAS NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED AND IS BASED UPON A CALCULATION PROVIDED BY AN EXTERNAL CONSULTANT.  THE AMOUNT OF OIL THAT REACHED WATER IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  ENBRIDGE IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING SEVERAL METHODOLOGIES TO CALCULATE THIS VOLUME, AND WILL COMMUNICATE THE METHODOLOGY AND SUBSEQUENT VOLUME TO PHMSA UPON COMPLETION.     THE SECTION THAT FAILED HAS BEEN SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF NTSB. PENDING THE RESULTS OF METALLURGICAL TESTING AND FAILURE INVESTIGATIONS, ENBRIDGE IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND FINAL DATA FOR THIS ORIGINAL REPORT SUBMISSION. INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT IS TO BE CONSIDERED ESTIMATED UNTIL SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL REPORTS ARE FILED. NTSB, PHMSA AND ENBRIDGE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS ACCIDENT HAVE COMMENCED. AS THIS INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CAUSE(S) HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED.    TO DATE, ENBRIDGE HAS NOT FOUND ANY POTABLE WATER SOURCES (PUBLIC OR PRIVATE) WITH DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION THAT HAS BEEN VERIFIABLY LINKED TO THE ENBRIDGE RELEASE. THE ASSESSMENT OF ALL DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE AFFECTED AREA IS ONGOING. ENBRIDGE IS IN THE PROCESS OF SAMPLING DRINKING WATER SOURCES AND IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IN EVALUATING DRINKING WATER FROM POTABLE WELLS TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH.    ENBRIDGE ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION. THESE CHARGES INCLUDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRUDE OIL RELEASE, COSTS TO REPAIR THE PIPELINE AND RELATED INSPECTION COSTS, POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY THIRD PARTIES, AND LOST REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO ACCURATELY PROJECT THE TOTAL COST OF THE LEAK AND ITS REMEDIATION, HOWEVER WE ARE UNABLE TO BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE SPECIFIC DETAIL REQUESTED IN THIS FORM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORTS.

LINES 1 AND 2 WERE SHUT DOWN AS A PRECAUTION AND ENBRIDGE PIPELINE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO INVESTIGATE.  AFTER HAND-EXCAVATING THE IMPACTED AREA, A SMALL CRACK WAS DISCOVERED AND CONFIRMED ON THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM OF LINE 2 AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 PM LOCAL TIME.   THE DEFECT WAS LOCATED IN A MARSHY AREA AND THE SITE ACCESS AND INVESTIGATION PROGRESS WAS HAMPERED BY POOR SITE ACCESS AND GROUND CONDITIONS. EXTERNAL NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND MINNESOTA STATE DUTY OFFICER WERE MADE UPON CONFIRMATION OF THE LEAK.  NOTIFICATIONS WERE ALSO MADE DIRECTLY TO THE MINNESOTA OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY, PHMSA, MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY AND THE MINNESOTA INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER.    ONCE THE PIPE WAS EXCAVATED THE ENTIRE LONG SEAM OF THE JOINT OF PIPE IN QUESTION WAS FIELD ASSESSED BY NDE (BOTH UT AND MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION).  NO OTHER DEFECTS WERE IDENTIFIED.  AN INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED BY ENBRIDGE'S PIPELINE INTEGRITY GROUP AND THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED USING A PLIDCO SPLIT SLEEVE.  THE RETURN TO SERVICE PLAN WAS REVIEWED WITH PHMSA AND MNOPS AND LINE 2 WAS RESTARTED ON APRIL 18 AT APPROXIMATELY 7:10 PM.     THE INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT OF THIS LINE SEGMENT IS ONGOING AND THE SECTION OF PIPE IN QUESTION WILL BE CUT OUT FOR FURTHER METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WHEN CONDITIONS ALLOW.   ENBRIDGE ENVIRONMENT GROUP IS MANAGING SITE CLEANUP AND RESTORATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH A NUMBER OF AGENCIES (BOTH LOCAL AND STATE).    A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AND THE LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE THE RESULT OF A HOOK CRACK THAT WAS FORMED AT THE TIME OF PIPE MANUFACTURE WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY EXTENDED BY FATIGUE THROUGH THE REMAINING THICKNESS OF THE PIPE.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT WAS FOUND TO SUGGEST THAT EITHER POST MANUFACTURING MECHANICAL DAMAGE OR CORROSION HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE FLAW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LEAK.  THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATED SOIL REMOVED FROM THE LEAK SITE WAS 30 CUBIC YARDS.",

ENBRIDGE SUPERIOR REGION OPERATIONS AND CENTRAL REGION OPERATIONS (CANADA) WERE NOTIFIED AND DISPATCHED. UPON ARRIVAL,  COMPANY PERSONNEL DISCOVERED A LEAK ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY 3,000 BARRELS CONTAINED PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY RIGHT-OF-WAY. ADDITIONAL  COMPANY RESOURCES WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED TO CONTROL AND CLEAN-UP THE RELEASED OIL, INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE AND TO REPAIR  THE PIPELINE FOR RETUM TO SERVICE. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND NORTH DAKOTA STATE INCIDENT REPORTING HOTLINES WERE CONTACTED.    THE PRELIMINARY CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE RUPTURE WAS A FAILURE IN A SECTION OF THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM OF THE PIPE. THE AFFECTED PIPE SEGMENT WAS  REMOVED DURING THE REPAIR AND HAS BEEN SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY METALLURGICAL  LAB FOR ANALYSIS. THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED AND WAS RESTARTED ON  JANUARY 13, 2010 AT APPROXIMATELY 09:17 LOCAL  TIME. SITE DEAN-UP (SOIL EXCAVATION) IS CURRENTLY STILL  BEING COMPLETED; HOWEVER NO LONG TERM  REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED.    A PHMSA REPRESENTATIVE WAS ONSITE DURING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND REPAIR ACTIVITIES AND WAS INVOLVED WITH THE RETUM TO SERVICE PLAN.  ENBRIDGE WILL BE WORKING WITHPHMSA DURING THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL BE SHARING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION\/FAILURE ANALYSIS.    SUPPLEMENTAL\/FINAL REPORT (UPDATE AS OF APRIL 1,, 2011)    THE METALLURGICAL INVESTIGATION THAT WAS CONDUCTED CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF A FATIGUE CRACK THAT INITIATED AT A LOCATION ALONG THE FLASH WELDED SEAM, FROM THE INSIDE PIPE DIAMETER. THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO PRE-EXISTING WELDING OR PIPE BODY DEFECTS, OR MATERIAL PROPERTY DEFICIENCIES THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO CRACK INITIATION, CRACK GROWTH, OR FINAL FAILURE.  WELD MISALIGNMENT AND PEAKING WERE OBSERVED AT THE INITIATION LOCATION.  THE CRACK GREW IN SERVICE UNDER CYCLIC LOADS UNTIL IT REACHED A CRITICAL SIZE AND RUPTURED.    SITE CLEAN UP IS COMPLETED AND THE LEAK SITE HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN CLOSED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SECTION OF THE NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.  APPROXIMATELY 4760 CUBIC YARDS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WERE DISPOSED OF AT AN APPROVED LAND FILL.",

        "text3": "<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> ON JANUARY 7, 2010 AT APPROXIMATELY 1300 HOURS, A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR USING A TRENCHER STRUCK THE PLAINS RED RIVER EAST PIPELINE NEAR MP 75. THE PIPELINE WAS IN A SCHEDULED SHUTDOWN CONDITION WHEN IT WAS STRUCK. THE CONTRACTOR IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED  PLAINS AND TOOK  MITIGATION  MEASURES TO CONTAIN THE RELEASE. THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED IN THE  EXCAVATED TRENCH. THE  RELEASE WAS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WHEN A VACUUM TRUCK ARRIVED. THE VOLUME RELEASED PRIOR TO THE RELEASE BEING CONTROLED WAS CALCULATED AT APPROXIMATELY 160 BBLS. AN ADDITIONAL 540 BBLS. OF CONTROLLED DRAIN UP FROM THE PIPELINE WAS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE REPAIR OF THE PIPELINE.    A ONE CALL NOTIFICATION FOR THIS EXCAVATION ACTIVITY WAS RECIEVED BY PLAINS ON DECEMBER 15, 2009.  THE EXCAVATION FOR THIS ONE CALL WAS TO BE A TRENCH LOCATED PARALLEL TO THE PLAINS PIPELINE. THE PLAINS OPERATOR VISITED THE EXCAVATION SITE  AND  CLEARED AND RELEASED THE ONE TICKET ON DECEMBER 17, 2009. THE TICKET WAS CLEARED BASED ON THE OPERATOR OBSERVING THAT THE EXCAVATION MARKINGS SHOWED THAT THE TRENCH WOULD BE EXCAVATED PARALLEL TO THE PLAINS PIPELINE. THE OPERATOR CONDUCTING THE LOCATE ASSUMED THAT THE PIPELINE ALIGNMENT WAS IN A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THE PIPELINE MARKERS THAT EXISTED ON EACH END OF THE EXCAVATION ALIGNMENT. THE TRENCHING WAS THROUGH A HAY MEADOW AND THE PIPELINE MARKERS WERE LOCATED AT EACH END OF THE MEADOW. BETWEEN THE MARKERS AT EACH END OF THE MEADOW, THE PIPELINE HAS A BEND AND IS NOT LOCATED IN A STRAIGHT LINE  BETWEEN THE MARKERS. THE CONTRACTOR STRUCK THE PIPELINE AT THE BEND. THE OPERATOR'S INAPPROPRIATE AND INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT THE  PLPELINE  DID NOT DEVIATE  FROM  A STRAIGHT LINE ALIGNMENT, AND HIS FAILURE TO LOCATE AND PROPERLY MARK THE LINE RESULTED IN THIS ACCIDENT. THE OPERATOR DID NOT REVIEW ANY PIPLINE ALIGNMENT DRAWINGS PRIOR TO PROCESSING THE ONE CALL TICKET.    THE PIPELINE OPERATOR WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM PERFORMING \"0Q\" COVERED TASKS INVOLVING ONE CALL LINE  LOCATING.  HE WILL BE RETRAINED AND REQUALIFIED FOR LINE  LOCATING TASKS PRIOR TO PERFORMING LINE LOCATING DUTIES .",
