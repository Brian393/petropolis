This means that gas leakage from fracking operations has become a crucial driver of rapidly accelerating climate change.", "EPA": "A recent study used infrared camera imagery to identify leaking well pads and measure their emissions. It was found that a small fraction of individual sites, so-called \"superemitters,\" accounted for a majority of the methane released by the oil and gas industry. Would it be likely to find more such superemitters in a site that has been recklessly developed at high speed over the last decade? Here is a quote from the study's abstract:<br><br>\"We performed helicopter-based infrared camera surveys of more than 8,000 O&G well pads in seven U.S. basins to assess the prevalence and distribution of high-emitting hydrocarbon sources... The proportion of sites with such high-emitting sources was 4% nationally but ranged from 1% in the Powder River (Wyoming) to 14% in the Bakken (North Dakota)... Over 90% of almost 500 detected sources were from tank vents and hatches\" (source <a href='http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acs.est.6b00705'>here</a>).<br>", "Notes": "" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -103.15397, 47.4106 ] } }
