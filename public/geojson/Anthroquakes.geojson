But in November of 2011, three earthquakes above magnitude 5.0 struck the Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone in Oaklahoma, with an epicenter near the town of Prague. Despite stonewalling by state officials, the US Geological Survey soon identified the <a href='http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/induced-earthquakes-raise-chances-of-damaging-shaking-in-2016/' target='_blank'>cause</a>: disposal wells that inject heavily salinated fracking water deep underground, at a rate of some 160 million barrels a month in 2013. Just four wells named Sweetheart, Chambers, Flower Power and Deep Throat, all operated by the New Dominion corporation that pioneered the technique, are alleged by scientists to have <a href='http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6195/448' target='_blank'>provoked 20%</a> of the recent seismic activity. The numbers went from an historical average of 22 quakes above 3.0 per year, to 1,010 in 2015. For a few tense years, more earthquakes occured in Oaklahoma than in California.<br><img src='images/USGSmap.jpg'><br><h5 style='text-align:center'>earthquake risk map (article <a href='http://gizmodo.com/induced-earthquakes-could-get-pretty-nasty-thanks-to-f-1752179540'>here</a>)</h5><br>In a research letter published in 2015, a group of scientists warned that Cushing, Oklahoma, is <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064669/epdf' target='_blank'>threatened by earthquakes</a>, constituting a national security risk. Cushing is the site of the world's largest petroleum storage facilty, located directly in the formerly inactive Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone. With a capacity of some 90 million barrels, Cushing is the trading hub for West Texas Intermediate crude delivered by the 'Basin' and 'Centurion' pipelines. This is the oil that underlies the <a href='http://www.ogfj.com/articles/2012/11/the-cost-of-crude-at-cushing.html' target='_blank'>CME NYMEX futures contract</a>, which sets the benchmark for oil prices across the earth. The disposal wells produce the risk that the financial markets hedge against, setting the stage for a dramatic spiral with earth-system consequences.<br><br>Under pressure from the public - spurred on by USGS science - the state of Oaklahoma enacted new regulations that have brought earthquake frequency down (though the problem has not gone away). What kind of politics could do the same thing for the catastrophic global warming risks caused in large part by the oil and gas industry?<br>" },
