The Macondo well was supposed to be a blowout of shareholder value for CEO Tony Hayward. One day before, BP and Transocean officials visited the rig to pressure the crew to finish the job. Later it came out that managers <a href='http://www.nola.com/news/gulf-oil-spill/index.ssf/2010/08/bp_manager_boss_both_ignored_w.html'>deliberately ignored warnings</a> about the cement plug that was meant to cap off the drilling.<br><br>After the explosion and fire on April 20, 2010, the rig collapsed and sank two days later. Five thousand feet below, the wellhead continued spewing into the Gulf of Mexico until June 15 - about five million barrels, fifteen times the quantity leaked by the Exxon Valdez. The most cynical thing was the public relations bombardment with Corexit, <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/riki-ott/an-open-letter-to-us-epa_b_697376.html'>a chemical dispersamt</a> denounced by marine toxicologist Riki Ott.<br>The BP spill was the worst environmental disaster in the US since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The consequences are ongoing.<br>",
