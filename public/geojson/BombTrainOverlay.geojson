"text1": "From every direction the Chicago metropolitan area is traversed by <a href='http://explosive-crude-by-rail.org/' target='_blank'>explosive Bakken oil trains</a>. Who do they serve? What message are they trying to deliver?<br><br>Chicago is the freight hub of North America. Almost all the North Dakota oil bound for East Coast ports and refineries passes over the city's aging rail infrastructure. Despite protests around the country, neither the government nor the corporations have moved to change anything fundamental about the rolling pipeline that carries volatile crude bubbling with methane gas through highly populated urban areas. Yet the derailment of a Chicago-bound BNSF train on March 5, 2015, just outside of Galena, Illinois, left no doubt about the risks involved.<br><br>If you see the 1267 hazmat placard on a long train of a hundred black tank cars, you can be sure it's a bomb train. How can such a danger be ignored?",
