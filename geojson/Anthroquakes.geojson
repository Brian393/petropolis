But in November of 2011, three earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 to 5.6 struck the Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone in Oaklahoma, with an epicenter near the little town of Prague. An unprecedented spike in earthquake swarms had been observed since 2009. After initial resistance from the state level, the US Geological Survey now admits the <a href='http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/induced-earthquakes-raise-chances-of-damaging-shaking-in-2016/' target='_blank'>cause</a>: disposal wells that inject heavily salinated and chemically laced fracking water deep underground, at a rate that has increased from about 80 million barrels of waste water a month in 1997 to about 160 million barrels a month in 2013. Four wells named Sweetheart, Chambers, Flower Power and Deep Throat are alleged by scientists to have <a href='http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6195/448' target='_blank'>provoked approximately 20%</a> of the recent seismic activity. They are all operated by the New Dominion corporation that pioneered the disposal technique. The overall numbers went from an average 22 quakes of 3.0 or above per year, to 1,010 in 2015. More earthquakes now occur in Oaklahoma than in California.<br><img src='images/USGSmap.jpg'><br><h5 style='text-align:center'>earthquake risk map (article <a href='http://gizmodo.com/induced-earthquakes-could-get-pretty-nasty-thanks-to-f-1752179540'>here</a>)</h5><br>In a research letter published in 2015, a group of scientists warned that Cushing, Oklahoma, is <a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064669/epdf' target='_blank'>threatened by earthquakes</a>, constituting a national security risk. Cushing is the site of the world's largest petroleum storage facilty and it's located in the formerly inactive Wilzetta-Whitetail fault zone. With a capacity of some 90 million barrels, Cushing is the trading hub for West Texas Intermediate crude delivered by the 'Basin' and 'Centurion' pipelines. This is the oil that underlies the <a href='http://www.ogfj.com/articles/2012/11/the-cost-of-crude-at-cushing.html' target='_blank'>CME NYMEX futures contract</a>, which sets the benchmark for oil prices across the earth. The disposal wells produce the risk that the futures market hedges against, thus setting the stage for a dramatic spiral with earth-system consequences.<br><br>What's happening in Oaklahoma can be termed 'Anthropocene risk' - the final frontier of financial speculation. It is generated when large-scale industrial economies threaten their own continuity, by treating earth-system processes as a mere 'externality' whose maintnenance costs can be left off the account books. Anthropocene risk occurs when capitalist civilization treats the planet as a dump. That's exactly what is being done by the oil and gas industry.<br>"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.686378,35.497488]}}]}
