The USCG requested the SSC on scene. The Initially, it was \u000bunknown how much home heating oil was lose from the barge. The barge was loaded \u000bwith 56,000 barrels (2,352,000 gallons) and had a draft of 17.9 feet. It struck a \u000brock charted at 18 feet mean low water. Due to the stage of the moon, falling \u000btide, and offshore winds the water depth over the rock was minimal. The tug was \u000bhugging the CT coast to stay in the lee of winds from the NW as it headed to its \u000bdestination in Port Jefferson, NY. The barge was taken to a nearby location (41deg \u000b02.6 N / 73deg 22.053 W) and anchored.\u000b\u000bThe NOAA Scientific Support Team provided the USCG initial trajectory and oil \u000bweathering information, weather, tides, and resources at risk summary.\u000b\u000bAt about 0800 the CT Department of Aquaculture closed the shellfish beds in all \u000bwaters in the Norwalk, Darien, and Westport area until further notice.\u000b\u000bThe divers survey discovered 14 cracks and holes in all six starboard tank \u000bbottoms. The original estimate of cargo loss by the naval architect was 450 \u000bbarrels (18,900 gallons). \u000b\u000bTwo morning overflights (0900 and 1200) by USCG personnel spotted an oil slick \u000bextending several miles from the barge.\u000b \u000bA relief barge arrived along side the holed barge at about 1400. \u000b\u000bAt 1600 the SSC, RP rep and USCG FOSC went on an overflight in a helicopter. A \u000bsheen consisting of light rainbow to silver and gray was observed several miles \u000bfrom the barge. It measured about 3.5 miles long by 200 yards wide at the leading \u000bedge and 600 yards wide at the trailing end. The rest of LI Sound was search and \u000bnot other oil was located. The overflight also mapped locations of ice along the \u000bLI coastline. A new trajectory model was developed based on the GPS positions of \u000bthe slick.\u000b\u000bWith the updated oil trajectory model showing land impacts on the northern Long \u000bIsland coast plans were made to pre-position protective boom as several location \u000bnear identified sensitive areas.\u000b\u000bBy the evening meeting at 1800 the revised estimate of lost oil was downgraded to \u000babout 53 barrels (2,226 gallons). This estimate was within the range of oil \u000bobserved on the afternoon overflight.\u000b\u000bPlans were made to begin over-the-top lightering operation during the first \u000bnight, but due to logistics and operational constraints they were unable to begin \u000buntil later the morning of the 15th. \u000b\u000bOn 2/15 the morning overflight only spotted one small streamer of light silver \u000band gray sheen within the area predicted by the trajectory model. The stern \u000bstarboard quarter of the barge was seen to be awash. No oil was observed near the \u000bbarge or anywhere near the LI coast. Almost all of the oil had evaporated and \u000bnaturally dispersed.\u000b\u000bThe NOAA modelers were requested to provide a ?Worst Case Discharge\" trajectory \u000bfor a possible release from the barge on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The \u000bnew model indicated potential land impacts on LI more westerly than the oil that \u000bwas initially released.\u000b\u000bBased on the updated weather forecasts for significantly worsening weather, the \u000bUnified Command decided to move the barge into Bridgeport harbor for safe haven \u000bto make temporary repairs and off-load the cargo. At present, as of 1800 this \u000bevening (2/15) the barge is in route to Bridgeport. Travel time is anticipated to \u000bbe about 5 hours at two knots.

Upon arriving at the \u000bcommand center at noon the SSC was briefed about the barge explosion and \u000bsubsequent gasoline spill. The barge (what was left of it) and manifold system on the \u000bdock were still on fire. The location of the ExxonMobile facility was: 40deg 31.5 N / 74deg 14.5 \u000bW. Trajectory and weather support were requested ASAP as well as resources at risk. Oil \u000bweathering calculations determined that the gasoline would evaporate very quickly \u000b(about 90% in the first several hours). The two major biological concerns from the \u000benvironmental point of view were rafting waterfowl and potential fish kill. The SSC \u000brecommended that the fire be left burning as long as possible as long as it posed no \u000bfurther hazard to the facility or workers, to minimize the amount of gasoline released onto \u000bthe waterway. The other safety concern expressed was the potential for gasoline to \u000bbecome trapped under piers and docks creating the potential for other explosive \u000bconditions.\u000b\u000bThe two pipelines from the facility to the pier that were ruptured contained about 150,000 \u000bgallons each from the value to the end. One was on fire and the other leaking onto the \u000bfacility.\u000b\u000bAt 1530 the SSC and a MSRC representative went on an overflight of the area on a \u000bUSCG helicopter. The SSC took video footage and digital photographs of the event as \u000bwell as mapping the extent and quantity of oil observed in the Arthur Kill. At the time of \u000bthe flight the tide was ebbing to the south. Oil was noted at the entrance to the Kills, for \u000bthe most part remaining in the center of the waterway. The gasoline was mostly rainbow \u000band gray sheens extending up to the facility. North of the site there were two other \u000bsheens noted, one probably leaching from the landfill site and another mystery sheen. \u000bThe smoke plume was very visible. It wafted up about 125 feet to 300 feet and northward \u000bover Staten Island. The SSC returned to the command post and presented the video and \u000bobservations to the unified command. The gasoline was for the most part non-\u000brecoverable. It was estimated that the amount observed was in the thousands of gallons, \u000bnot tens of thousand or hundreds of thousands. Most of the fuel spilled was consumed in \u000bthe fire or evaporated.\u000b\u000bThe SSC notified Tri-State Bird Rescue of the spill and potential for oiled birds. No birds \u000bwere found to be oiled.\u000b\u000bThe SSC also converted video footage taken by the Vessel Traffic Service into a digital \u000bformat for distribution to the media and investigating agencies.\u000b\u000b22 February 2003 ? \u000bThe SSC was supposed to participate in a first light overflight with the USCG. However, \u000bthe rain and fog prohibited the aircraft from flying. \u000b\u000bAt the 0800 unified command meeting a situation update was given. The manifold was \u000bstill burning and would be attempted to inert and cap that morning. Joint investigations \u000bwere underway by the NYC Fire Department Fire Marshals, Police Department Arson \u000bInvestigations, US Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board. The \u000binvestigators were attempting to map the location of all of the debris. DonJon Marine was \u000bpreparing a salvage plan. The Kills were still under one-way traffic with tug escorts. A \u000bsight safety plan was in place.

Due to the potential for an additional release during this period, skimmers and dispersants (Corexit 9500) were maintained as standby response measures.

The pilot prepared for passage through the \"Million Dollar Bridge,\" an extremely narrow draw bridge, affording less than five feet of clearance on either side of the vessel's mid-section.  Accounting for a rising tide and southwesterly winds, the pilot approached the opening from the northern portion of the Fore River and misspoke the helm command.  By the time the order could be corrected, less than a minute later, the vessel was committed and allision (a moving object hitting a stationary one) imminent.\u000b\u000bThe Julie N struck the southern side of the bridge,  a sharp buttress damaged her just below the waterline  The exposed part of the bridge opened a 15-foot hole into the forward port bunker tank, the forward void space, and the number one port cargo tank.  The gash in the cargo tank was small by comparison to that of the bunker tank,  less than a foot wide and approximately three feet  high.  The bunker tanks were carrying intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380.\u000b\u000bThe vessel reported the allision immediately to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and asked permission to proceed to the Sprague Terminal, some 1,000 yards downriver.  Permission was granted.  The Julie N headed for the terminal, leaking oil as she went.  The local oil spill cooperative, Clean Casco Bay, Inc., was notified as were state and federal authorities.  As the ship was tying up to the Sprague pier, state and spill cooperative personnel were deploying a variety of booms around the injured vessel.  During that time, USCG personnel on-scene, estimated that the vessel was leaking at a rate of 500 to 700 gallons per minute.  Over the course of the next 12 hours, the Julie N would lose a total of 180,000 gallons of oil, 88,200 gallons of HHF and 93,450 gallons of IFO 380.

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.\u000bStabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.\u000bAugust 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.\u000bBy August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.\u000bMeanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.\u000bThe GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.\u000bRoughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.\u000bSeawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.\u000bCleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.  NOAA is working with the  RRT, the GST, the Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, State officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method for dealing with the tarmats.  Additional on-scene participation by NOAA is anticipated.  USCG district 7.

The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed.  However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the  USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there.  Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable.  Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: \"Chelsea Creek\") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river.  Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea.  Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side.  The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill.  Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar.  The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials.  The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s.  The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s.

(UMTB) Tank Barge 283, towed by the tug Marine Explorer, began sinking stern down approximately 35 miles southeast of Simeonof Island, on the western side of the Gulf of Alaska.  The tug and barge, en route to Dutch Harbor with approximately 47,620 barrels of diesel on board, encountered extremely rough weather.  The pump room and starboard aft tanks, which had been empty, were now flooded, causing the barge to turn bow-up with approximately 80 feet of the barge above water and the remaining 200 feet below the surface.  The tug's crew members observed oil coming from the vicinity of the waste oil tanks in the stern area.  Although the barge owner speculated that the stern anchor had punctured the aft waste oil tank, the exact cause of the sinking was never determined.  The salvage vessel M/V Salvage Chief  hired by Seattle-based UMTB arrived on January 7 after an eight-day passage from Astoria, Oregon.  Meanwhile, the barge continued leaking diesel fuel as 50-60 knot winds and 20-25 foot seas pounded the area. The tug Salvage Chief arrived on-scene January 7 with divers and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to investigate the bottom of the barge.  Small cracks found in the port and starboard main decks were sealed with wooden plugs.\\\\After considering all the options, UMTB asked the USCG for assistance in sinking the barge.  The barge was sunk by the USCG Cutter Sedge  at 1246 on January 13, 1989, approximately 11 miles southwest of the Semidi Islands at 55 48 N and 156 46 W.\\\\Due to the location of the spill, on-scene weather conditions, and the rate of oil leakage, no cleanup action was performed.\u000bBy January 4, only 40 feet of the barge's bow remained above the surface.  From the attitude of the barge, the owner's naval architects and salvage master speculated that four tanks remained filled with diesel fuel while the other tank's cargo was displaced by water.\u000bInitially, the owner requested resource agency clearance to move the barge to Stepovak Bay for lightering and repair operations.  As the barge, with the tug and tow line still attached, drifted northeast parallel to the coast, evaluations of Stepovak, Castle, Devil's, and Kuiukta bays, along the southeastern side of the Alaska Peninsula, were requested of NOAA.  The upright-floating barge was extremely difficult to tow.  The vessels were caught in a clockwise back-eddy off of the southwesterly flowing Alaska stream which carried them towards the northeast.\u000bThe weather remained severe (Beaufort Force 9 with icy conditions) throughout the entire incident.  Even though the tug Marine Explorer remained attached to the barge, it was virtually impossible for it to influence their naturally drifting motion and trajectory.  On January 11, 1989, the owners requested USCG assistance in sinking the barge.  On January 13, the USCG Cutter Sedge  used 1500 rounds of 20 mm fire to sink Barge 283 in approximately 102 fathoms of water.  The case was closed on January 18, 1989.  USCG district 17.

The tug Scandia was abandoned and USCG Search and Rescue teams were dispatched to assist the crew.  At approximately 2000 EST, a USCG helicopter reported that the barge North Cape was aground on Nebraska Shoals, directly adjacent to the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The helicopter further reported that the barge was releasing oil.  The barge North Cape spilled oil in two separate releases.  The first, released during the height of the initial storm, was 700,000 gallons and the second, less than a day later, was 125,000 gallons.  The combination of the type of oil released and the energy of the storm caused great dispersion into the water column.  As a result, in the days following the spill, great numbers of shellfish (mostly bivalves and juvenile lobsters) washed  ashore.  Subsequently, the Rhode Island Department of Health closed more than 200 square miles of commercial fishery in the area of the spill.  This closure was coordinated with the EPA Region One and with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which closed federal fishing grounds using the Magnuson Act.  This is the first time federal fisheries have been closed due to oil contamination.  The emergency phase of the response lasted seven days and the on-scene command post was demobilized following the removal of the barge North Cape from the beach.  Active USCG spill response and assessment continued from the MSO, including re-survey of key impacted recreational and endangered piping plover nesting beaches.

The cause is under investigation by USN, including the Judge Advocate General's office, but it is clear that a valve was left open which overfilled a day tank, fed from a larger storage facility.  Initially, the USN reported to the National Response Center that 1,000 gallons of fuel had been spilled.  Soon after that report, the amount was updated to 20,000 gallons and then to 100,000 gallons.  The official spillage finally was determined to be 112,000 gallons.  The oil flowed from the day tank into an underground drainage pipe, which runs under a runway and several roads for several hundred yards.  The pipe empties into an open drainage ditch, which drains to a 29-acre mangrove forest.  This forest drains through a culvert into Ensenada Honda Bay (a.k.a.: Ensenada Bay).  The USN's primary environmental concern was the bay.  In the face of an approaching hurricane, USN Construction Battalion (a.k.a.: Sea Bees) personnel constructed a dam or plug at the culvert between the first impacted mangrove (later named \"mangrove A\") and the mangrove adjacent to the bay (later named \"mangrove C\").  This dam trapped the water in mangrove A, creating a buffer between the oil and the mangrove pneumatophores.  USCG district 7.

The CG and the SSC headed on-scene via a CG C-130 which overflew the Granite Pt. platform and the overturned Monarch hull just barely showing above the surface of the water. A couple of hours later it was reported that the Monarch had sunk to the seafloor in rougly 80 to 90 feet of water.    Due to the ice and strong currents, it was decided to attempt a salvage operation in the spring.     However, in March it was announced that the Monarch would be left on the bottom of Cook Inlet adjacent to the Granite Pt. platform.<br><br><strong>Max potential release:</strong> 50,000 gallons"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-151.48,60.95]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":7951,"title":"<strong>Marine Spill</strong>: 2009/01/15<br><br>","image":"<h2>US Air Crash</h2><br>","text1":"<strong>Location:</strong> Hudson River, NY","threat":"Oil","tags":"","text2":"<strong>Materials involved:</strong> Jet Fuel","max_ptl_release_gallons":6300,"posts":11,"text3":"<strong>Description:</strong> At 3:31 PM January 15, 2009 the US Air flight 1549 crashed into the Hudson River.

These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers.    Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal.  They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm.  No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time.  Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm.   The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm.    The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others.  \u000b       The last  major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4.  It was the largest eruption, during this sequence,  and produced the largest lahar to date, completely encircling the Drift River Tank Farm (DRTF).    None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility.   As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the  DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels.    To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks.   \u000b     With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.\u000b   <br><br><strong>Max potential release:</strong> 6,216,000 gallons"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-152.7,60.5]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":8002,"title":"<strong>Marine Spill</strong>: 2009/04/01<br><br>","image":"<h2>Diversified Environmental Services</h2><br>","text1":"<strong>Location:</strong> Tampa Bay, FL","threat":"Oil","tags":"Collision","text2":"<strong>Materials involved:</strong> Waste oil","max_ptl_release_gallons":5000,"posts":4,"text3":"<strong>Description:</strong> At 1130local, April 1, 2009, as a result of a collision while docking, roughly 2300gal (estimate as of noon, 2Apr09)) of waste oil (slops) was discharged from a barge owned by Diversified Environmental Services, Inc., into McKay Bay, a secondary bay of Tampa Bay, FL.

The barge has 72,000 gallons of gasoline and 72,000 gallons of Jet fuel.  The barge is a 1968 single skin barge.   The grounded barge had gone through two tidal cycles, during which the tug could not pull it off the bottom, prior to notifying CG Sector Anchorage on Sept. 17.    No fuel has been released into the the environment.    The CG requested that the NOAA SSC provide weather and tidal information.  \u000b   Shortly after the grounding a second barge, the OB-5, was summoned from Bethel 80 miles to the north.   Barge OB-5 was able to liter 60,000 gallons of Jet fuel from barge 160-1 and delivered 55,000 gallons to tanks at Quinhagak.   Upon returning to 160-1, barge OB-5 itself grounded just west of the location of the 160-1.
